ENABLE_K8S_AUDIT_LOG
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter enables customers to disable or enable the Kubernetes API server audit log.
The expected value is "true" or "false".
The default value is "false".
Example:
ENABLE_K8S_AUDIT_LOG="true"
KUBE_DNS_HOSTS
Configuration of this parameter is mandatory in a non-DNS environment.
This parameter specifies a hosts file that will be used for the node's host name resolution in Kubernetes cluster when no DNS
server is available in the environment or some nodes can't be resolved by DNS server. This hosts file is a temporary file.
During the installation, OMT will get all the related information in the hosts file and store them to the parameter 
kube-dns
 of a
ConfigMap file.
If no DNS server is available, you must create a hosts file and add the mappings for all control plane nodes, all worker nodes,
NFS server nodes, and external database nodes in the following format.
<NODE_IP> <Your_NODE_FQDN>
If you specify a custom FQDN rather than a node host name's for the external access host, list the mapping for the external
access host.
You must also list the resolution mapping for the external load balancer host in the 
hosts
 file if you use FQDN of the external
load balancer for the high availability of control plane nodes.
For example,
192.0.2.0 external-accesshost.mycompany.com
192.0.2.1 control1.mycompany.com
192.0.2.2 control2.mycompany.com
192.0.2.3 control3.mycompany.com
192.0.2.4 worker1.mycompany.com
192.0.2.5 worker2.mycompany.com
192.0.2.6 worker3.mycompany.com
192.0.2.7 externalbalancer.mycompany.com
192.0.2.8 externaldb.mycompany.com
192.0.2.9 NFS.mycompany.com
Example:
KUBE_DNS_HOSTS="/home/admin/hosts_file"
FAIL_SWAP_ON
Specifies the impact of swap setting on cluster nodes to OMT installation. SMA requires swap to be enabled on all control plane
nodes and worker nodes, and this parameter must therefore be set to "false". The default value of this parameter is "true".
Example:
FAIL_SWAP_ON="false"
CRT_HTTP_PROXY
Configuration of this parameter is mandatory if any of the following are true:
Access to Docker hub requires a proxy (unless the upload and download of images is performed on a separate machine)
Access to an external registry requires a proxy
Access to the remote log location (such as Elasticsearch or OBA) requires a proxy, and you are using fluentd forwarding
This parameter specifies the HTTP proxy URL for Container.
The expected value is a URL.
By default, a proxy isn't configured.
Example:
CRT_HTTP_PROXY=proxyserver.mycompany.com:8080
CRT_HTTPS_PROXY
