<external_access_host>
: the FQDN you've allocated for the suite. For example, 
www.example.com
.

. 
Run the following command to apply the saved YAML file:
kubectl create -f installation-portal-ingress.yaml
Now an ALB is created and the Ingress for port 3000 is bound to this ALB automatically.
Bind FQDN with Application Load Balancer
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. In this installation
procedure example, Amazon Route 53 is used to bind an FQDN (<external_access_host>) such as www.example.com to
ALB so that end users can easily access the suite from web browsers.

. 
Save the following file as 
createRecord.json
:
{
    "Comment": "Create Alias resource record sets in Route 53",
    "Changes": [
        {
            "Action": "CREATE",
            "ResourceRecordSet": {
                "Name": "{{resource_record_set_name}}",
                "Type": "A",
                "AliasTarget": {
                    "HostedZoneId": "{{alb_hosted_zone_id}}",
                    "DNSName": "{{alb_dns_name}}",
                    "EvaluateTargetHealth": false
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

. 
Run the following commands to specify your own values for the alias record set:
sed -i -e s@{{resource_record_set_name}}@${EXTERNAL_ACCESS_HOST}@g ./createRecord.json
sed -i -e s@{{alb_dns_name}}@${ALB_DNS}@g ./createRecord.json
sed -i -e s@{{alb_hosted_zone_id}}@${ALB_HOSTED_ZONE_ID}@g ./createRecord.json
where:
{EXTERNAL_ACCESS_HOST}
 is the FQDN prepared for the Application Load Balancer.
{ALB_DNS}
 is the DNS name of the created Application Load Balancer. You can find the DNS name of the ALB on
its 
Description
 tab.
{ALB_HOSTED_ZONE_ID}
 is the hosted zone ID of the created ALB. For example, 
Z1H1FL5HABSF5
. You can find
your ALB's hosted zone ID by running the following command. Replace 
{ALB_DNS_Name}
 with your actual value.
alb_hosted_zone_id: aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query "LoadBalancers[?DNSName==\`${ALB_DNS_Name}\`].CanonicalHostedZoneId" --output text
3
. 
Update the AWS CLI by following the steps described in the 
AWS CLI documentation
.
4
. 
Run the command below to create the Route 53 record set:
route53_hosted_zone_id=$(aws route53 list-hosted-zones-by-name --query "HostedZones[?Name==\`${domain_name}.\`].Id" --output text | sed s@/hostedzone/@@g)
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id ${route53_hosted_zone_id} --change-batch file://./createRecord.json
Replace 
${domain_name}
 with your actual value.
Now, you can access 
https://<external_access_host>:3000
 to start the installation.
