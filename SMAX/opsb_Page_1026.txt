Bastion node
Once the Azure file share is ready, log on to the bastion and set up volumes to store the generic data by following these steps:
1
. 
Install the NFS client on the bastion:
sudo yum install -y nfs-utils cifs-utils
2
. 
Copy and save the following script as 
mountazurefile.sh
:
#!/bin/bash
MOUNTPOINT=/mnt/nfs/$3
sudo mkdir -p $MOUNTPOINT
if [ ! -d "/etc/smbcredentials" ]; then
sudo mkdir /etc/smbcredentials
fi
if [ ! -f "/etc/smbcredentials/$1.cred" ]; then
    sudo bash -c "echo username=$1 >> /etc/smbcredentials/$1.cred"
    sudo bash -c "echo password=$2 >> /etc/smbcredentials/$1.cred"
fi
sudo chmod 600 /etc/smbcredentials/$1.cred
sudo bash -c "echo //$1.file.core.windows.net/$3 $MOUNTPOINT cifs nofail,vers=3.0,credentials=/etc/smbcredentials/$1.cred,dir_mode=0775,file_mode=0775,serverino,mfsymlinks,uid=$4,gid=$5 >> /etc/fstab"
sudo mount -t cifs //$1.file.core.windows.net/$3 $MOUNTPOINT -o vers=3.0,credentials=/etc/smbcredentials/$1.cred,dir_mode=0775,file_mode=0775,serverino,mfsymlinks,uid=$4,gid=$5

. 
Run the following command to mount the Azure file share for the 
generic
 data to bastion:
sudo ./mountazurefile.sh  <storage_account_name> <storage_account_key> <generic_fileshare_name> <system_user_id> <system_group_id>
In this command,
<storage_account_name>
 is the name of the created FileStorage account.
<storage_account_key>
 is the key you got when creating the Azure file share.
<generic_fileshare_name>
 is the name of the Azure file share for storing the 
generic
 data.
<system_user_id>
 and 
<system_group_id>
: specify an operating system user ID and group ID that are used to run the
process in the container, respectively. Both values must be 1999 or a number between 100000 and 2000000000.

. 
Run the following commands to create directories for the 
generic
 data:
cd /mnt/nfs/<generic_fileshare_name>
sudo mkdir  -p var/vols/itom/itsma/core
sudo mkdir  -p var/vols/itom/itsma/db-backup-vol
sudo mkdir  -p var/vols/itom/itsma/db-single-vol
sudo mkdir  -p var/vols/itom/itsma/global-volume
sudo mkdir  -p var/vols/itom/itsma/db-volume
sudo mkdir  -p var/vols/itom/itsma/smartanalytics-volume
sudo mkdir  -p var/vols/itom/itsma/itom-logging-vol
In these commands,
<generic_fileshare_name>
 is the name of the Azure file share for storing the 
generic
 data.
5
. 
Run the following command to test the performance of the Azure file share. 
Do not proceed if the result can't meet
the minimum requirement.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/nfs/<general_fileshare_name>/small.img bs=512 count=10000 oflag=dsync
In this command, 
<general_fileshare_name>
 is the name of the Azure file share for storing the 
generic
 data.
The output looks as below:
10+0 records in
10+0 records out
5120 bytes (5.1 kB, 5.0 KiB) copied, 0.0713496 s, 
71.8 kB/s
The minimum requirement for the suite installation is 
60 kB/s
. Based on the performance tests, the command returns an
output higher than 60 kB/s in most Azure regions.
Any number smaller than that will cause the installation to fail, in which case you have two options:
Considering using 
Azure NetApp Files
.
Contact Azure support to fix the performance issue.
6
. 
Run the following commands to create a namespace for OMT and generate the secret under the OMT namespace for
Kubernetes to access the Azure file share:
kubectl create ns core
