OPB Certificates
Introduction 
When creating an integration to Service Management Automation X with a remote system that has an SSL address, it is possible that
the certificate of the remote server must be imported into the trusted keystore file of the On-Premises Bridge (OPB). The cacerts file
stores public certificates of root Certificate Authority (CA). If there is a problem with the connection between the OPB and the remote
system, check the controller.log file of the OPB for the error defined below. If the error exists, then you may be required to follow the
procedure described in this document.
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed:
sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target

Finding the location of the Service Management Automation X OPB controller
log
The default location of the controller.log file is in the 
C:\Program Files\HP\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\log\controller
 directory.
Once the log file is located, search the log file for the HandshakeException error. If the error appears, the Fully Qualified Domain
Name (FQDN) will be logged, which will allow you to verify that the endpoint in question was indeed the one that is giving the error.
Finding the location of the Service Management Automation X OPB trusted
keystore
The default OPB trusted keystore file is named 
cacerts
 and is located in the 
C:\Program Files\HP\On-Premises Bridge
Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\lib\security
 directory. The OPB has its own file and should not be confused with any other Java
installation on the machine.
Obtaining the certificate of the remote server
In most cases there is a company created certificate available and the server administrator will be able to send it to you. In cases
where this is not available, it is also possible to use a browser (Firefox, for example) to export the certificate so that it can be
imported into the OPB’s trusted keystore.
Adding the certificate to the trusted keystore
The java keytool utility is used to import certificates into the trusted keystore. To run the utility, open a command window and
navigate to C:\Program Files\HP\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\bin directory. The format of the necessary
command is as follows:
keytool -import -keystore ..\lib\security\cacerts -alias "new Alias" –file myCert.crt .
In this example the 
myCert.crt
 file is the certificate of the remote server, 
cacerts
 is the trusted keystore, and the alias is a label set
for the certificate. When prompted for a password, “changeit” is the default.
C:\Program Files\Micro Focus\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\bin>keytool -import -keystore ..\lib\security\cacerts -alias "new Alias" -file
c:\myCert.crt
How to identify if the certificate is present
Java uses a tool named keytool to list or import any certificates in the trusted keystore file. Using this tool allows you to list all the
certificates that were imported into the keystore. Open a command window and navigate to the 
C:\Program Files\HP\On-Premises
Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\bin
 directory. Run the keytool while pointing to the cacerts file. Syntax for the command
is: 
keytool –list –v –keystore ..\lib\security\cacerts > c:\contents.txt
C:\Program Files\Micro Focus\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\bin>keytool -list -v -keystore ..\lib\security\cacerts > c:\contents.txt
Enter keystore password:  changeit
The default password for the keystore is “changeit”. Once executed, a file named c:\contents.txt will list the entire content of the
keystore. It is possible to search through this file in notepad or a similar text editor to confirm that the certificate for the remote
server to confirm was loaded correctly.
