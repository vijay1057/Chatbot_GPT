Install Audit collector on-premises
This section provides the steps required to install the Audit collector.
Generate vault secrets
To generate vault secrets for the Audit collector chart, perform the following steps on the control plane node:
1
. 
Run the following command:
$CDF_HOME/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n <Audit Producer Namespace> -c <Audit Collector Chart File> -o <Secrets YAML File>
Where:
<Audit Audit Producer Namespace> is the namespace in which the Audit Producer is running.
<Audit Collector Chart File> is the tar file containing the Audit collector installation charts (
audit-collector-
<version>.tgz
)
<Secrets YAML File> is the YAML file that stores the Audit collector secrets. Specify the file name (for
example, 
audit-collector-secrets.yaml
), and then the script will generate this YAML file after you run the script.
You will need to use this file when you run the command to install the Audit collector.
For example:
/opt/cdf/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n itsma-cfpni -c audit-collector-<version>.tgz -o audit-collector-secrets.yaml
2
. 
The vault secret utility prompts you for the following passwords:
Key
Required
Description
audit-collector-integration-user-pass-key
Yes
Audit collector integration user password.
Install Audit collector
To complete the deployment, you will need to install the Audit service using Helm.
Run the following command:
$helm install audit-collector <Audit Collector Chart> -n <Audit Producer Namespace> -f values.yaml -f audit-collector-secrets.yaml --set-file "caCertificates.cert_one\.crt"=/path/to/cert_one.crt --set-file "caCertificates.cert_two\.crt"=/path/to/cert_two.crt
Where,
<Audit Collector Chart> is the tar file containing the Audit collector installation charts.
<Audit Producer Namespace> is the namespace where the Audit producer is running.
<Values YAML File> is your 
values.yaml 
file with properties configured for the Audit collector deployment.
<Audit Collector Secrets YAML file> is the file that gen_secret script generates and holds the Audit collector secrets.
For example:
$helm install audit-collector audit-collector-<version>.tgz -n itsma-cfpni -f values.yaml -f audit-collector-secrets.yaml --set-file "caCertificates.idm\.crt"=idm.crt --set-file "caCertificates.auditservice\.crt"=ase.crt
Note
: Make sure you deploy Audit collector in the same namespace where the Audit producer is running. Audit
collector requires the Audit producer file system and it will use the Audit producer PVC and subpath.
