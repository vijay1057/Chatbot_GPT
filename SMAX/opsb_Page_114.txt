In this release, we are introducing additional Software Asset Management (the new SAM capability) features:
Adobe content for user-based licenses
You can now 
calculate license compliance for Adobe products
 with the out-of-the-box license rule 
Adobe user-based
licensing
. 
Currently, SAM's Adobe content is available only to the classic or containerized CMS 2021.05 or later deployments.
In this release, SAM only supports Adobe's named-user licenses and their compliance calculation.
Analyze end-of-support product information
You can now view the number of products that will reach the end of support (EOS) date within a year. This helps you better
manage your products' license compliance. See 
View EOS products
.
License compatibility matrix - Upgrade
When you need to purchase new licenses, SAM can calculate the number of highest-level licenses required to fulfill your
license shortage according to the upgrade path. You can maintain the upgrade relationships following publishers' official
documents by using an easy-to-use graphic editor. See 
Maintain license compatibility matrix
.
Export/Import
You can now export and import product information and dependent data (including product compatibility matrix and
relationships between product versions and license rules) from SAM's Products page.
Count product instances
You can now view the number of product instances installed in your environment from the EOS report and product list.
Service Management
This release introduces the following enhancements for Service Management.
Multiple dashboards
In this release, agent users with the appropriate role permissions can create dashboard definitions for self-use or for sharing
with specified audiences or all agent users. This way, agent users can view appropriate dashboards from their dashboard home
page. See 
Dashboard definitions
 and 
Overview of dashboards

Note
: To use this feature in an upgraded tenant, the suite admin needs to 
perform a crawling upgrade
 and the tenant admin
needs to 
add new fields to the Full person form
.

CI synchronization control through Subtype and sd_type mapping
Not all the CIs discovered by Universal Discovery are relevant to SMAX users. After the integration of SMAX 2021.05 and
UCMDB 2021.05, you can use the SMAX Subtype and UCMDB sd_type mapping to control the synchronization of specific CIs
from UCMDB to SMAX. See 
CI type, attribute, and subtype federation
