The integration should now be functioning and can be confirmed by looking at the endpoint status.
The most common issues causing the task to fail:
Incorrect login and password for the Gmail account.
The IMAP settings are not configured on the email account.
The less secure app setting is not enabled.
The On-Premises Bridge agent is not running.
Troubleshooting
The OPB logs are in the 
C:\Program Files\Micro Focus\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\log
 directory. This directory should contain a
controller folder and an email-integration-domain folder. To make sure that the agent is running, look in the controller folder
for the 
controller.log
 file. Look through the log for any errors -- most likely they will be related to a login and password not
working.
If the agent is running, look in the email integration folder for the 
email-integration-domain.log.x.x
 file. Look for the most
recent file for any errors. There may be errors indicating that the Gmail account login or password is incorrect. There may also
be errors indicating that the inbox cannot be found, which may indicate that the firewall is blocking a port.
If the integration still doesn’t work, contact the 
Micro Focus
 Service Management Automation X Support team and create a
ticket. Be sure that the OPB log and configuration files are included in the ticket.
