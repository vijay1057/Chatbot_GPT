Another rule that could be added is to inform the Requester by email that their password has now been reset. To do this, you
could create a new Notification template or use an existing one.
To create one, go to Studio and then select Request.
Under Notification templates, click Add.
In the blank form, give the Notification a name and display name along with a subject line for the email.
Here is a table showing what can be entered as a Notification for the eExpense Application:
