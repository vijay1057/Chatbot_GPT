This will create the Endpoint for UCMDB on the OPB.
If UCMDB isn’t using SSL then skip the next section and go straight to Configuring the UCMDB Endpoint.
Configuring SSL for OPB
Before the OPB and UCMDB can communicate, SSL certificates need to be added to the Java keystores of the respective
servers. Otherwise, errors will be reported when trying to test the connection between the Service Management Automation X
Endpoint and UCMDB.
Export UCMDB Server Certificate
Run the following command on the UCMDB Server by opening a command prompt. If a server.keystore file already exists, then
remove it before running this command:
From 
<UCMDB-Installation-Folder>\bin\jre\bin
, run the following command:
keytool.exe -genkey -alias hpcert -validity 365 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore
C:\UCMDB\UCMDBServer\conf\security\server.keystore
Export the keystore file to be used by the Probe and OPB using the following command (when running this command, the
UCMDB Keystore password will be required based upon what was used during install):
keytool.exe -export -alias hpcert -keystore C:\UCMDB\UCMDBServer\conf\security\server.keystore -storepass <Password> -file
C:\UCMDB\UCMDBServer\conf\security\ucmdbserver.cert
Copy the ucmdbserver.cert file from the 
C:\UCMDB\UCMDBServer\conf\security
 folder to relevant folders on the Probe and OPB
servers.
If using the Integration Service on UCMDB Server, it would be as follows:
C:\UCMDB\UCMDBServer\integrations\conf\security
Probe Server it would be:
C:\UCMDB\dataflowprobe\conf\security
For OPB place in the following location:
C:\ProgramData\MicroFocus\On-Premise Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\lib\security
Import UCMDB Server Certificate
The certificate file needs to be loaded into the probe server(s) for them to communicate to the UCMDB Server via SSL over port
8443. This is done by running the following command:
From 
<UCMDBProbe-Installation-Folder>\bin\jre\bin
, run the following commands:
keytool.exe -import -trustcacerts –keystore C:\UCMDB\UCMDBServer\integrations\conf\security\server.truststore -storepass
<password> -alias hpcert -file C:\UCMDB\UCMDBServer\integrations\conf\security\ucmdbserver.cert
keytool -import -file <Certificate-File-Name> -keystore -Alias <Probe-Installation-Folder>\conf\security\HPProbeTrustStore.jks
When prompted for the password enter 
logomania
Finally the UCMDB Server Certificate needs to be loaded into the OPB truststore. This is done running the following command:
keytool.exe -import -keystore "
C:\ProgramData\MicroFocus\On-Premise Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\lib\security\cacerts
" -alias
hpcert -file "
C:\ProgramData\MicroFocus\On-Premise Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\lib\security\ucmdbserver.cert
"
