caCertificates
Yes
The content of the SMAX CA certificate encoded by base64.
To get the content of the SMAX CA certificate on Azure, follow
these steps:
1
. 
Access SMAX from a web
browser: 
https://<SMAX_External_Access_Host>:443
.
2
. 
Click the lock icon before the URL on the address bar.
3
. 
Export the site root certificate to a file with the Base-64
encoded X.509 (.CER) format. 
To encode the certificate as base64, run the following
command:
echo -e "caCertificates:\n  smax.crt: |\n    $(base64 -w 0 smax.crt)" > /tm
p/certificates.yaml
Then, copy the content with the encoded certificate in the
/tmp/certificates.yaml
 file to
 my-values.yaml
.
You must keep the original format of the certificate without
adding any spaces or changing the indentation.
Example:
caCertificates:
  smax.crt: |
    <certificate content 
base64 encoded>
