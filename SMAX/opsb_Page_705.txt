Download container images for CMS
To install an application, you will need to download the required installation images. You need:
Generate an image download tool package
Run the download script inside the tool package to download the required installation images.
Generate the download bundle
The 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 compares the images listed in the 
image-set.json
 file with the images that already exist
in the specified image organization of the specified registry. It will only download the missing images.
1
. 
Log on to the first control plane node.
2
. 
Run the following command to change the directory. 
cd  ${CDF_HOME}/tools/generate-download
3
. 
Run the command together with the options required by your deployment. For example, run the following command:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart <CMS helm chart file> -o <org name> [-d <destination dir>]
Where:
<CMS helm chart file>
: The absolute path to the downloaded CMS helm chart package.
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, it is
"hpeswitom".
<destination dir>
: The directory where the output .zip file is created. The default location is the current directory.
The generate_download_bundle.sh compares the images needed by the suite with the images that already exist in the
cluster, and generates a .zip file, 
offline-download.zip
, that enables you to download the required images from Docker
Hub. The 
offline-download.zip
 is placed under the current working directory unless the "
-d
" option is specified.
For example:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart CMS_Helm_Chart-202x.xx/cms-helm-charts/charts/cms-1.x.0+202x0x00.xxx.tgz -o hpeswitom -d /tmp
You receive the following messages indicating that you have successfully generated the offline-download.zip file:
[INFO] 2020-07-31 17:58:46 : ** Generating the offline image download bundle ...
[INFO] 2020-07-31 17:58:50 : Completed generation of offline-download.zip in /tmp
The offline-download.zip will be placed in the
 /tmp
 directory as specified. This file contains a list of the required images
and will be used when you run the Python script to transfer the suite images in the later step.
4
. 
Unzip the 
/tmp/offline-download.zip
 file and copy the 
/tmp/offline-download/image-set.json
 file to the <
OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx
>/scripts/
 directory.
Download the required installation images
1
. 
Log on to the first control plane node. If the first control plane node can't access Docker Hub, transfer the  
offline-download.z
ip
  file to a Linux server that can access Docker Hub.
2
. 
Extract the .zip package to a directory. If you can't access Docker Hub directly, set up the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. For
example, run the following commands to set the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Replace the placeholders with your actual server and
port. 
export http_proxy="<http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
export https_proxy="<https://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
3
. 
Go to the directory where you extracted the 
offline-download.zip
 package.
4
. 
Run the following command:
 
./downloadimages.sh [-r <image repository URL>] [-u <username>]  [-d <image download directory>] [-c on|off] [-o <org name>]
Where:
<image repository URL>: Specify the 
-r
 option if you want to download the images from a repository other than
Docker Hub.
Replace <
username
> with the Docker Hub username.
If you don't specify the credentials here, you will be prompted to specify them when you run the command.
<image download directory>: The directory where the container images will be downloaded. The default value is
/var/opt/cdf/offline.
The 
-c
 option is used to verify the digital signature of the images during the download. The default setting is off,
which doesn't verify the signature.
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, this is
