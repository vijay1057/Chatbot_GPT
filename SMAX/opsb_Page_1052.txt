Download container images (AKS)
Before you deploy the suite, you need to download the suite images from Docker Hub or other registries and then upload the
images to your registry.
Generate the image set
Before downloading and uploading the images, you need to generate the image set with the following steps on the bastion
node:
1
. 
On the bastion node, navigate to the OMT installation directory:
cd OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/tools/generate-download
2
. 
Run the following command to display the command-line options for the 
generate_download_bundle
 command:
./generate_download_bundle.sh -h
3
. 
Run the command together with the options required by your deployment. For example, run the following command:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart <CMS helm chart file> -o <org name> [-d <destination dir>]
Where:
<CMS helm chart file>
: The absolute path to the downloaded CMS helm chart package.
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, it is
"hpeswitom".
<destination dir>
: The directory where the output .zip file is created. The default location is the current directory.
The generate_download_bundle.sh compares the images needed by the suite with the images that already exist in the
cluster, and generates a .zip file, 
offline-download.zip
, that enables you to download the required images from Docker
Hub. The 
offline-download.zip
 is placed under the current working directory unless the "
-d
" option is specified.
For example:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart CMS_Helm_Chart-202x.xx/cms-helm-charts/charts/cms-1.x.0+202x0x00.xxx.tgz -o hpeswitom -d /tmp
You receive the following messages indicating that you have successfully generated the offline-download.zip file:
[INFO] 2020-07-31 17:58:46 : ** Generating the offline image download bundle ...
[INFO] 2020-07-31 17:58:50 : Completed generation of offline-download.zip in /tmp
The offline-download.zip will be placed in the
 /tmp
 directory as specified. This file contains a list of the required images
and will be used when you run the Python script to transfer the suite images in the later step.
4
. 
Unzip the 
/tmp/offline-download.zip
 file and copy the 
/tmp/offline-download/image-set.json
 file to the <
OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx
>/scripts/
 directory.
Download and upload images
To download and upload the generated images, follow the steps below:
1
. 
Download the 
Cloud Deployment 1.2.10 
package from the 
ITOM Marketplace
 website and unzip the package.
2
. 
Copy the 
smax-image-transfer.py
 file from 
.../Cloud Deployment 1.2.10/../byok
 to 
OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
.
3
. 
Run the following commands to transfer the suite images from the source registry to your registry:
Note
 As the containerized CMS will be installed together with SMAX, we recommend that you upload CMS images
together with that of SMAX. If you have already uploaded images to your registry, skip this step.
Note:
 To follow the steps in this section, you must have installed the 
zip
 Linux command on the node where you
run the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 script.
Note
  Python 3 is required to run the Python script below. Make sure Python 3 is installed on the bastion.
