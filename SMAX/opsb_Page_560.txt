Virtual agent language support
The smart virtual agent allows the use of multiple language models within one single tenant.
The normal virtual agent uses an IDOL engine that can provide answers in all languages that the suite supports, based on
content found in Knowledge, Catalog, Q&A, and Public Requests records.
Arabic/Hebrew support
The agent interface supports a right-to-left (RTL) layout for RTL languages. However, there are some limitations for certain UI
elements in the RTL layout:
RTL support isn’t available for the Expression Language. The related UI elements are always left-to-right aligned when you
view or edit the expressions.
RTL support isn’t available for some chart elements.
When a long text string is being truncated due to overflowing, the truncated text is left-to-right aligned.
RTL support isn’t available on the 
Smart Analytics Settings
 and  
Virtual Agent Settings
 pages.
In RTL mode, you can't drag and drop columns in a grid view.
In RTL mode, if you have the Remove action and Add action for grid columns in one operation, for example, if you remove
a column and add another column and then save the changes, the newly added column appears on the right side.
When the email receiver's language is set as Arabic or Hebrew, the "From email", "From name", and "Subject" fields in an
email template won't be converted to the RTL layout. This is because the three fields are defined in Studio rather than in
the email template. 
The DSL expression in the RTL email template isn't properly displayed, for example: 
{entity.Description:}$
, but this layout
issue won't affect the expression parse.
Optical character recognition (OCR)
The OCR feature supports all languages that the Service Portal supports.
OMT Management Portal
The OMT Management Portal always supports the English character set in addition to the character set of the local operating
system. For example, if you install OMT in a French environment, you can use both the English and French character sets.
Integrations
The suite supports integrations with many 
Micro Focus
 software products and third-party products. To view the support matrix
information of these integrations, visit the 
Integration Central
 website.
