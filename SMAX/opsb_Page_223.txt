Note the icons for Person, Location, Entitlement Rule, Time period and Group. On our data models from here on out we will add
these icons to any boxes that have relationships to each type. For example, Incident records reference several types of Core
Data, giving the following representation:
In this way, the icons show that the Incident has relationships to Person, Group, and Location.
In addition, in the full Data Model diagram, links to the Expense Line record type are represented by a dollar sign ($). A
separate Data Model for Expense Lines is included in this section to show specific relationships to that record type.
ITIL Record Types
To further simplify the Data Model diagram, the ITIL record types are combined into distinct groups when two or more record
types share the same relationships. There are three groupings:
Blue: All ITIL record types (request, incident, problem, change, and release)
Orange: request and incident
Light Green: change and release
When a relationship connects to or from one of these group boxes, it represents a relationship to all record types within that
box. In the example below we can infer relationships between:
Change relates to one ore more requests and change relates to one or more incidents
Both change and release related to one or more incidents
Full Data Model
Dotted lines represent a virtual relationship between record types. There is no physical relationship in the database structure,
but there is a relationship between the record types that's defined in SMAX's application code.
The complete Data Model follows:
