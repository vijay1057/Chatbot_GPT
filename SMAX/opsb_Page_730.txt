Install CMS on OMT
Role
Location
Suite admin
Control plane node
To install CMS, run the following command:
helm install <
CMS RELEASE NAME
> <
CMS CHART FILE
> --namespace <
CMS NAMESPACE
> -f <
VALUES YAML FILE
> -f <
SECRETS YAML FILE
>
Where,
<
CMS RELEASE NAME
>
 is the unique release name that you need to specify for the CMS deployment. You need to use the
same release name as specified here when you upgrade CMS in the future.
<
CMS CHART FILE
>
 is the tar file containing the CMS installation charts.
<
CMS 
NAMESPACE
>
 is the unique namespace of the CMS deployment. Use the namespace that you specified in the "Create
a deployment for CMS" topic.
<
VALUES YAML FILE
>
 is your custom 
my-
values.yaml 
file with properties configured for the CMS deployment.
<
SECRETS YAML FILE
> is the YAML file that stores the CMS secrets. This file is created when you run 
gen_secrets.sh
 to
generate vault secrets for CMS in the previous step.
For example:
helm install cms-prod CMS_Helm_Chart-202x.xx/cms-helm-charts/charts/cms-1.x.0+20xxxx00.xxx.tgz --namespace cms-prod -f my-values.yaml -f cms-secrets.yaml
(Optional) Install a classic Data Flow Probe
 If you want to use Universal Discovery, install a classic (non-containerized) Data Flow Probe.
You can download UCMDB 2022.11 (UCMDB-2022.11_Windows.zip or UCMDB-2022.11_Linux.zip) from the 
Micro Focus Software
Licenses and Downloads
 website.
For instructions on how to install the classic Data Flow Probe in UCMDB, see 
Deploy classic Data Flow Probe
.
For instructions on how to connect the classic Data Flow Probe to the containerized UCMDB server, see 
Configure external Data
Flow Probe to connect to the containerized UCMDB server
.
Note
You can run the above command with the 
--dry-run
 argument to simulate an installation. It is useful to
validate the content in the custom 
my-values.yaml 
file before a real installation.
After installation, you must delete the YAML file that stores the CMS secrets (for example, 
cms-
secrets.yaml
) as it contains sensitive data.
