In reality, each of the components and elements is composed of multiple virtual machines running on multiple physical
machines. In the future, we want every bit of this level of granularity to be part of our SACM database, but this will be enough
to get us started.Hey, that's not bad for a start, is it? I've defined the internal services that my team will provide for our
customers. And created a high-level configuration of each of the actual services we currently have in production. That seems
like enough work to deserve a coffee break.
Actually, before I have that coffee, let's look at another important service we provide to our users: Service Management. We
have two actual services to define: the IT Service Desk and the HR Help Desk. Our HR team is using SMAX to manage their
requests, while the IT department is using Service Manager. Our service structure looks like:
You can see that even though both services perform the same overall function (providing Service Management functions), they
have different components defined that support them. At a high level — the service levels — they are the same. But as we dig
deeper into the pieces that make them run, we see differences in the software used and the computers that run them.
Okay, now I definitely need that coffee. Why don't you review service definitions and think about how you would map your
own service infrastructure, and I'll be back in a short while to talk about the service catalog.
