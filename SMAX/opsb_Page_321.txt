Updates to multiple persons
One advantage to the Manage Persons API is that you can run updates on multiple records at the same time. When updating a
large number of persons, using a script is often the best method for generating the JSON payload. In the example below,
multiple contacts are being added to the system.
{
    "operation": "CREATE_OR_UPDATE",
    "users": [{
        "properties": {
            "Upn": "Steve.Austin@microfocus.com",
            "Email": "Steve.Austin@microfocus.com",
            "FirstName": "Steve",
            "LastName": "Austin",
            "OfficePhoneNumber": "5557788",
            "Location": "London",
            "IsMaasUser":"false"    
            
        }
    }, {
        "properties": {
            "Upn": "Mike.Bossy@microfocus.com",
            "Email": "Mike.Bossy@microfocus.com",
            "FirstName": "Mike",
            "LastName": "Bossy",
            "OfficePhoneNumber": "5557788",
            "Location": "New York",
            "IsMaasUser":"false"
        }
    }]
}
