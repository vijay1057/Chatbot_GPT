This topic provides an overview of the installation options and considerations and a To-Do list of tasks before, during, and after

Before you begin
Before you begin, think about the following questions. 
SaaS, on-premises, cloud, or OpenShift?  
SMAX is available as a 
SaaS solution
 worldwide; however, should your organization prefer you can deploy the solution on the
following types of platforms:
On-premises: install on physical or virtual machines.
Public cloud: install on a public cloud–Amazon Web Services (AWS) with EKS, Microsoft Azure with AKS, or Google Cloud
Platform (GCP). To learn more, read 
EKS deployment FAQs
, 
AKS deployment FAQs
, and 
GCP deployment FAQs
.
OpenShift: install on OpenShift Container Platform.
You use one of the two OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) installation packages to install the suite:
On-premises: Use the "Embedded-K8s" package to install the suite with the Kubernetes distribution embedded in OMT.
This type of deployment is also referred to as "embedded Kubernetes" deployment. 
Public cloud or OpenShift: Use the "External-K8s" package to install the suite with a Kubernetes distribution provided by a
cloud platform or OpenShift. This type of deployment is also referred to as "managed Kubernetes" deployment.
The following table describes each party's areas of responsibility when the suite is running on these platforms.
