The 
br_netfilter
 module is required to enable transparent masquerading and to facilitate Virtual Extensible LAN (VxLAN) traffic
for communication between Kubernetes pods across the cluster nodes. Therefore, you must make sure the 
br_netfilter
 module
is installed on all control plane and worker nodes before you set the system parameters.
Perform the following steps on all control plane and worker nodes to set the system parameters:
1
. 
Log in to the node.
2
. 
Run the following command to check whether the 
br_netfilter 
module is enabled:
lsmod |grep br_netfilter
If there is no return value, the 
br_netfilter
 module isn't installed. Run the following commands to install it:
modprobe br_netfilter
echo "br_netfilter" > /etc/modules-load.d/br_netfilter.conf
3
. 
Open the 
/etc/sysctl.conf
 file in a supported editor.
4
. 
Set the following system parameters according to the operating system that the node uses.
For Redhat 8.1 and later versions:
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
kernel.sem=50100 128256000 50100 2560
For Oracle Linux 7.8 and later versions:
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
fs.may_detach_mounts = 1
kernel.sem=50100 128256000 50100 2560
For other older operating systems, including supported versions of CentOS:
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 0
fs.may_detach_mounts = 1
kernel.sem=50100 128256000 50100 2560
5
. 
Save the 
/etc/sysctl.conf
 file, and then run the following commands to apply the updates to the node:
 
/sbin/sysctl -p
Important:
 The 
sysctl.conf
 file contains the following instructions:
# To override a whole file, create a new file with the same in
# /etc/sysctl.d/ and put new settings there. To override
# only specific settings, add a file with a lexically later
# name in /etc/sysctl.d/ and put new settings there.
You can ignore these instructions and update the 
sysctl.conf
 file directly with the settings described below.
