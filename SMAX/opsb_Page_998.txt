Additional hardware requirements for DND & OO
The system requirements for SMA and Design and Deploy (DND) can be planned while installing SMA or at a later point when
you are deploying DND on an existing SMA setup. 
First, make sure that you have determined your SMA deployment size by using the table in the "SMA size definitions" section. 
Then, use the following table to determine your DND deployment size. Note that this table is applicable to a single DND
instance. If you will enable DND for multiple tenants (one DND Instance for each tenant), you need to determine the
deployment size of each individual DND instance.

The numbers in the table are meant to be approximate for a given deployment
environment, but not exact. For example, a Small environment may only create 5
offerings, or 10 per category, although the table lists a representative number of
20. In your anticipated environment, you may find the expected numbers of
tenants to span multiple profile definitions (for example, the number of active
subscriptions may fit the Small deployment, while the number of offerings may fit
the Medium profile). In such a case, select the profile that seems most
representative of your anticipated environment, with the number of total
subscriptions of particular importance. The sizing configuration is based on the
results of in-house performance testing against these deployment environments.
In general, you should find the need to tune the configuration parameters after
the installation, as the components can be scaled manually as needed, to support
the size of the environment you have specified.

Use the table below to plan the additional hardware resources for each individual DND instance. The additional hardware
resources for DND are the total of the additional hardware resources for all DND instances. The table includes the hardware
requirements for OO also as it is required for DND. 
For OO, choose one of the following options for setting up a database:
Note
: For AFS and Postgres HA configuration, follow the recommendations provided in vendor-specific
documentation. Example: To configure Postgres HA, see 
High Availability PostgreSQL with Patroni

Important: 
When you are installing DND functionality on an existing setup, you need to reconfigure the
hardware resources as per the recommendations given in the below tables to accommodate the required
additional resources.
