If you chose to use the default location for logs (NFS will be used by default), you can skip this topic. If you chose to use log
locations other than the NFS server, say Elasticsearch Server or Splunk, you should follow this topic.
To accumulate, aggregate, and persist OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) logs, you must provide one remote log location to
preserve the related logs.
By default, the OMT logs will be exported to a volume on an NFS.
To use other log locations follow the related instructions below according to the log type you choose. Following are the other
log locations that are available:
Elasticsearch server
Splunk
Export logs to Elasticsearch
To use an Elasticsearch server as the remote destination for logs, you must set up Elasticsearch before you install OMT.
You must also configure the 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_URL
 and 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_TYPE
 parameters in the 
install.properties
file. The following parameters are optional:
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_USER
: The user name of the log receiver
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_PASSWORD
: The user password of the log receiver
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_TOKEN
: The token of the log receiver
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_CA
: The absolute path of CA certificate of the log receiver. It's mandatory if 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_T
YPE
 is '
elasticsearch
' and 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_URL
 is '
https
' protocol.
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_ES_CLOUDID
: The cloud ID of 
elasticsearch
 which is used for connecting the log receiver
The configuration of these parameters depends on the configuration of the Elasticsearch server. See the "Configure the
install.properties file" topic. 
To view the collected log data, visit 
http://<
your Elasticsearch host
>:<
Elasticsearch port
>
.
Export logs to Splunk
To use Splunk service as the remote destination for OMT logs, you must set up Splunk before you install OMT.
You must also configure the 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_URL
 and 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_TYPE
 parameters in the 
install.properties
 file
before you start the installation. The following parameters are optional:
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_USER
: The user name of the log receiver
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_PASSWORD
: The user password of the log receiver. It's mandatory if 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_USER
 is
set.
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_TOKEN
: The token of the log receiver (Splunk token)
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_USER
 and 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_PASSWORD
 aren't necessary if 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_TOKEN
 (Splunk
token) has value. The configuration of these parameters depends on the configuration of Splunk. See the "Configure the
install.properties file" topic. 
Alternatively, you can also specify the command line option 
--fluentd-log-receiver-url
 and 
--fluentd-log-receiver-type
 of
the 
install
 command while you install OMT.
