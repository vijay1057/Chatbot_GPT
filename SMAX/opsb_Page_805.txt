Is the AWS EKS solution an HA solution? There are only a few worker nodes suggested in the sizing guide for EKS
deployment. Can they guarantee HA for a specific deployment?
Yes, it's an HA solution. The EKS solution is leveraging the auto scaling group to guarantee node level fail-recovery. That is,
once a worker node isn't healthy or has crashed, a new node will be added to the group to replace it. It guarantees HA for your
deployment. If you have more budget on computing resources, you may add more worker nodes to improve availability.
Can I change the RDS instance type dynamically without downtime?
It may be covered by the AWS side. It depends on how you configure your RDS structure.
There is minimal downtime when you are scaling up on a Multi-AZ environment because the standby database gets upgraded
first, then a failover will occur to the newly sized database.
However, a Single-AZ instance will be unavailable during the scaling operation.
Do we still need to write 500 GB dummy data in EFS on EKS to improve EFS performance? What's the suggested
size for dummy data?
Yes. The dummy data is used to make sure you have enough credits for continuously writing with a good throughput rate. For
a more precise dummy data size, you can keep monitoring the EFS Burst Credits by following the link below:

Another way to optimize this is to use provisioned throughput mode.
