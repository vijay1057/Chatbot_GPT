saved, the new publisher is added to the publisher list. The new metric can be used with any license rules that require this
algorithm to work out license usage.
License rules
In the current version of SAM, more than 20 rules come out of the box. More rules will be generated and published with later
releases of SAM. In most cases for the majority of vendors, the OOTB rules should be sufficient. If new rules are required, you
can either create new or clone existing rules depending on your business requirements.
For more information on how to create a new rule or clone one, see 
License rules
