Click 'ok' to proceed.
The username and password in the ‘Setup authentication’ form is the account used to login to Service Management
Automation X. The username combined with the OPB configuration file tells the agent how to connect to the Service
Management Automation X tenant. Enter the authentication information and click next.
Click the install button to initiate the installation.
After the installation portion has completed you will need to complete the configuration of the agent by copying the ‘
server-
connection.conf
’ file downloaded in the previous step to the conf folder of the OPB (by default located in the 
C:\Program Files\M
icro Focus\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\conf
 directory).
Import the SMAX certificate into the On-Premises Bridge's trusted certificates. This must be done to successfully connect.
For details, see 
How to import the suite CA certificate to the OPB trusted keystore
Once the certificate is imported and the ‘
server-connection.conf
’ has been copied, start the On-Premises Bridge service
(this service is not started by default after the installation).
