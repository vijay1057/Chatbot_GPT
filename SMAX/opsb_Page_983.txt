Download and upload images for Audit collector
Before you deploy the Audit collector, you need to download the required images from Docker Hub or other registries and then
upload the images to your registry.
Note:
 If you have already uploaded images to your registry, skip this step.
Generate the Image Set
Before downloading and uploading the images, you need to generate the image set with the following steps on the bastion
node:
1
. 
Run the following command to change directory:
cd /<OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/tools/generate-download>
2
. 
Run the following command to display the command line options for the 
generate_download_bundle
 command:
./generate_download_bundle.sh -h
3
. 
Run the command together with the options required by your deployment. For example, run the following command:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart <audit collector helm chart file> -o <org name> [-d <destination dir>]
Where:
<audit collector helm chart file>: The absolute path to the downloaded Audit collector helm chart package.
<org name>: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, it's
"
hpeswitom
".
<destination dir>: The directory where the output.zip file gets created. The default location is the current directory.
Note
: Running this command may take several minutes.
The generate_download_bundle.sh compares the images needed by the suite with the images that already exist in the cluster
and generates a .zip file, 
offline-download.zip
. This file enables you to download the required images from Docker Hub.
For example:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart Audit_Collector_Helm_Chart-2022.11/audit-collector/charts/audit-collector-1.0.0+20221100.51-SNAPSHOT.tgz -o hpeswitom -d /tmp
You will find the 
offline-download.zip
 under the current working directory unless you specify "
-d
" option. You receive the
following messages indicating that you have successfully generated the
 offline-download.zip
 file:
[INFO] 2020-07-31 17:58:46 : ** Generating the offline image download bundle ...
[INFO] 2020-07-31 17:58:50 : Completed generation of offline-download.zip in /tmp
Then, you can find the image set file 
image-set.json
 in the current directory. This file contains a list of the required images
and you will need this when you run the Python script to transfer the suite images in a later step.
Create ECR repositories
Before pushing images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), you need to create a repository for each image. Make sure
to save the 
create_aws_repositories.py
 script to 
OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx
 on the bastion (see 
Create ECR
repositories
). Then, run the following command on the bastion to create ECR repositories in a preferred region:
python create_aws_repositories.py -r <ecr_region> -o hpeswitom -i ./image-set.json
Where:
<ecr_region>
 is the region where you will put your ECR repositories and it can be different from the region you selected to
place all the prepared AWS resources. 
Download and upload images
1
. 
Copy the 
smax-image-transfer.py
 file from the following directory:
Cloud Deployment x.x.x/byok
 to 
OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
2
. 
Run the following commands to retrieve the username and password of EC.
If you've installed AWS CLI version 1 when configuring bastion:
cd OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
dockerLogin=$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region <ecr_region>)
ecrUserName=$(echo $dockerLogin | awk '{print $4}')
ecrUserPassword=$(echo $dockerLogin | awk '{print $6}')
ecrURL=$(echo $dockerLogin | awk '{print $7}' | awk -F/ '{print $3}')
