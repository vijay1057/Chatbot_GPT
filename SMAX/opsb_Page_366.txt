Configuring the UCMDB Endpoint
Once the OPB is configured and the UCMDB certificate uploaded into the Java keystores, one final configuration is required.
The Endpoint created earlier needs to be configured. Go to the Endpoint and click on 
Configure
. Enter the environment
details for the external UCMDB similar to the example below:
Click on 
Test Connection
. If everything is configured correctly then you should see a success message:
Click 
Save
 to keep the configuration settings. The OPB will then deploy a package to the UCMDB Server. This will configure an
Integration Point within UCMDB along with the adapter that will be used to map data from UCMDB to Service Management
Automation X.
To see the Integration Point in UCMDB, go to 
Data Flow Management -> Integration Studio
. You should see an
Integration Point with the name of the OPB Agent and the Tenant ID for Service Management Automation X. From there you
can view the jobs that will run under the Integration Point and see the CIs that are passed from UCMDB to Service Management
Automation X.
