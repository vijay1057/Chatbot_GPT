(Optional) Install the Audit service on EKS
The Audit service installation is optional. 
The Audit service is an independent service that enables your system to perform audits for critical events. 
The Audit service is mainly composed of the following components:
Audit event producer: SMAX acts as an audit event producer by using a library bundled with itself.
Audit service engine: An independent microservice that you deploy using a Helm installer. It includes the audit service
gateway that uses REST APIs and the audit database that stores audit data.
Audit UI: An independent reporting microservice that you deploy using the same Helm installer. This UI displays audit
data. 
When a 
predefined audit event
 happens, the audit service creates an audit log record in the audit database and displays the
record in the
 Audit UI
