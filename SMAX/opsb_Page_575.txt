the 
install
 command (see 
Install OMT (on-premises)
).
Parameter
Description
--db-user
External database user name.
--db-password
External database password.
--db-url
External database connection URL.
--db-crt
External database CA certificate (if not specified, OMT will use the database in a nonsecure way).
OMT IdM database: this database is normally referred to as the "OMT database," which is the OMT IdM database. You will
need to configure this database later in the installation portal UI. 
When specifying a password for an OMT database user, make sure that the password meets the following requirements:
Has 10 to 16 characters
Has at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
Has at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
Has at least one of these special characters: 
,\:/. _?&%=+-[]()
Has at least one digit (0–9)
Follow the instructions below to prepare databases for the OMT API Server and IdM. 
Perform the following steps to create a non-public schema external PostgreSQL databases for the OMT API Server and IdM.
OMT doesn't support using the public schema for an external PostgreSQL database. This requires database administrator
credentials.
Note
: you will need to specify the database connection settings later when running the 
install
 script to install OMT.
1
. 
Log in to the PostgreSQL server and then run the following command to connect to the PostgreSQL instance. Replace
<postgres admin> with your actual value. 
psql -U <postgres admin>
2
. 
Run the following commands to create an external database and a user. Be sure to wrap the password in single quotes.
Replace the placeholders with your actual values. 
CREATE USER <cdfapiserver> login PASSWORD '<user_password>';
GRANT <cdfapiserver> TO <postgres admin>;
CREATE DATABASE <cdfapiserverdb> WITH owner=<cdfapiserver>;
3
. 
Run the following command to connect to the <cdfapiserverdb> database. Replace the placeholder with your actual
value. 
\c <cdfapiserverdb>;
4
. 
Run the following commands to change the public schema and revoke the public role of the database. Replace the
placeholders with your actual values. 
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO <cdfapiserver>;
ALTER SCHEMA public RENAME TO <cdfapiserver>;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA <cdfapiserver> from public;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA <cdfapiserver> to <cdfapiserver>;
5
. 
Run the following command to set "search_path" from public to non-public. Replace the placeholders with your actual
values.
ALTER USER <cdfapiserver> SET search_path TO <cdfapiserver>;
The following is an example of the commands above:
CREATE USER cdfapiserver login PASSWORD 'mypassword';
grant cdfapiserver to postgres;
CREATE DATABASE cdfapiserverdb WITH owner=cdfapiserver;
\c cdfapiserverdb;
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO cdfapiserver;
ALTER SCHEMA public RENAME TO cdfapiserver;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA cdfapiserver from public;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA cdfapiserver to cdfapiserver; 
ALTER USER cdfapiserver SET search_path TO cdfapiserver;
Note that if you need to reinstall OMT later, make sure the external database is empty, which means the database doesn't
contain any database object, such as tables, procedures, and views.
Note
: You need to manually create the OMT API Server database, and you can let the system automatically
create the OMT IdM database later during the installation.
