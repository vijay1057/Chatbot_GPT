Parameter
Required
Description
Default
Example
SMAX integration parameters
If you use shared IdM, or if you want to set up Native SACM or enable SAM in SMAX, you must configure the following
parameters.
Parameter
Required
Description
Default
cmsgateway.deployment.smax.host
Yes
The FQDN of the load balancer for accessing the SMAX APIs
smax.example.com
cmsgateway.deployment.smax.port
Yes
The listening port on the load balancer for accessing the SMAX APIs
443
443
cmsgateway.deployment.sam.host
(For SAM
only)
Yes
The FQDN of the load balancer for accessing the SAM APIs. The
value of this parameter is the same as that of
the 
cmsgateway.deployment.smax.host
 parameter.
smax.example.com
caCertificates
Yes
The content of the SMAX CA certificate encoded by base64.
To get the content of the SMAX CA certificate on AWS, do one of
the following accordingly:
If you 
requested a certificate
 by AWS Certificate Manager
during the SMAX installation, follow these steps:
1
. 
Access SMAX from a web
browser: 
https://<SMAX_External_Access_Host>:443
.
2
. 
Click the lock icon before the URL on the address bar.
3
. 
Export the site root certificate to a file with the Base-64
encoded X.509 (.CER) format. 
If you 
imported a certificate
 to AWS Certificate Manager during
the SMAX installation, use the imported certificate.
To encode the certificate as base64, run the following command:
echo -e "caCertificates:\n  smax.crt: |\n    $(base64 -w 0 smax.crt)" > /tmp/certi
ficates.yaml
Then, copy the content with the encoded certificate in the
/tmp/certificates.yaml
 file to
 my-values.yaml
.
You must keep the original format of the certificate without adding
any spaces or changing the indentation.
Example:
caCertificates:
  smax.crt: |
    <certificate content 
base64 encoded>
See the example in
the screenshot
after this table.
Certificate example:
Note
: The examples in the following table show the SMAX external access host. However, as a best practice
for SMAX integration, we recommend that you isolate internal integration from external access by updating SMAX
integration parameters later when you 
Create Application Load Balancer for integration
