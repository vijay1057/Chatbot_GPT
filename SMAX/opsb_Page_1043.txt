. 
Before downloading and uploading the images, you need to generate the image set with the following steps:
1
. 
Run the following command to change directory:
cd <OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx>/tools/generate-download
2
. 
Run the following command to display the command-line options for the 
generate_download_bundle
 command:
./generate_download_bundle.sh -h
3
. 
Run the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 command together with the options required by your deployment. For
example, run the following command. Replace all the placeholders with the actual values.
./generate_download_bundle.sh -m <suite metadata> -s itsma -v <suite version> -o hpeswitom -d <offline-download.zip location>
For example:
./generate_download_bundle.sh -m /directory/containing/suite-metadata.tgz -s itsma -v 202x.xx -o hpeswitom -d /tmp
Note that this example contains placeholder values.
The 
offline-download.zip
 will be placed in the 
/tmp
 directory as specified. This file contains a list of the required
images and will be used when you run the Python script to transfer the suite images in the later step.
4
. 
Unzip the 
/tmp/offline-download.zip
 file and copy the 
/tmp/offline-download/image-set.json
 file to the <
OMT_External_K8s_
202x.xx-xxx>/scripts/
 directory.
b
. 
Then follow these steps to download and upload the images:
1
. 
Download the 
Cloud Deployment 1.2.10 
package from the 
ITOM Marketplace
 website and unzip the package.
2
. 
Copy the 
smax-image-transfer.py
 file from 
.../Cloud Deployment 1.2.10/../byok
 to 
OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
.
3
. 
Run the following commands to transfer the suite images from the source registry to your registry:
cd OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
python3 smax-image-transfer.py -sr <source_registry> -su <source_username> -sp <source_password> -so <source_orgname> -tr <target_registry> -tu <target_username> -tp <target_password> -to <target_orgname>
In these commands,
<source_registry>
 is the URL of the source registry. For example, 
registry.hub.docker.com
.
<source_username>
 is the username of the source docker registry. Obtain it from 
Micro Focus
 if you use
Docker Hub; otherwise, contact the admin of the source registry.
<source_password>
 is the password of the source docker registry. Obtain it from 
Micro Focus
 if you use
Docker Hub; otherwise, contact the admin of the source registry.
<source_orgname>
 is the organization name in the source docker registry. Use 
hpeswitom
 if you use
Docker Hub; otherwise, contact the admin of the source registry.
<target_registry>
 is the URL of the target registry. If you don't have an Azure Container Registry, go to
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/container-registry/
 to create one in the same region as the AKS
cluster.
<target_username>
 is the username of the target docker registry. Obtain it from the admin of the target
registry.
<target_password>
 is the password of the target docker registry. Obtain it from the admin of the target
registry.
<target_orgname>
 is the organization name in the target docker registry. Obtain it from the admin of the
target registry.
