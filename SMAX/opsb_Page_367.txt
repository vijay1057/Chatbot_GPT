Once the Integration Point has been deployed, the sync will take place, running the TQL queries that comprise the Integration
Job within the Integration Point. When all jobs have finished successfully, the output from these jobs will be sent to OPB and
stored in the following location:
<On_Premise Bridge Folder>\Product\Util\Repository\
When a Sync takes place it pulls in the data held in the 
task_input_data
 and sends it across to the 
task_output_data
. Once
all data has been loaded into Service Management Automation X, these folder locations should be empty.
 
 
Verifying Data Synchronization
To determine what data has been imported into Service Management Automation X, go to the UCMDB Endpoint.
Open one of the Sync tasks to see exactly what has been added to Service Management Automation X
