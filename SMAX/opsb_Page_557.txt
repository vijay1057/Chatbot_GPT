Limitations
The external access host FQDN of the suite environment must contain at least three portions (for example:
myhost.mydomain.mynet
). An FQDN of two portions (for example: 
myhost.mynet
) isn't supported.
Kubernetes
Version 1.25
Databases
In a production environment, you must use the following external databases. 
Component
Supported database
OMT API Server
PostgreSQL 14.x, 13.x, 12.x, 11.x for
Linux
OMT IdM
Suite IdM, Suite Administration, Service Management and Smart
Analytics, and Autopass
PostgreSQL 14.x, 13.x, 12.x, 11.x for
Linux
SAM
PostgreSQL 14.x, 13.x, 12.x, 11.x for
Linux
DND
PostgreSQL 14.x, 13.x, 12.x, 11.x for
Linux
CGRO
Both of the following databases are
required:
PostgreSQL 14.x, 13.x, 12.x, 11.x for
Linux
Vertica 10.0.x with SSL enabled
Containerized CMS
PostgreSQL 14.x, 13.x,12.x, 11.x
Operations Orchestration (OO) Containerized 
PostgreSQL 14.x, 13.x, 12.x, 11.x
For the performance and functionality of the system, the external database must meet the requirements described in 
Prepare
external databases
.
Note
Ensure that the cluster nodes are still in the same subnet after installation.
