Okay, so I probably need to follow our corporate guidelines and enlist the help of someone with a little more artistic talent than
I have, but you get the idea.
Since our service desk also supports some of our external customers, I should point out we can also have different “themes”
based on the user’s group, location, or role by again using entitlements. So each of our customers can have a different look
and feel for their portal, and different offerings in each.
At this point, we have our end-user facing service catalog pretty much ready to go. Next, we’ll take a look at how our Agents
can process these requests quickly and easily.
Of course, details for 
customizing the Service Management Automation Service Portal
 can be found in the online
documentation.
