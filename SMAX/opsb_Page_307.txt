Sending a REST command to create an entity using the EMS API
Click on the “+” to add a new REST configuration. Enter the URL for the EMS API. For example:
https://smaxswinfra.net/rest/484980393/ems/bulk. Select the Post option, set the Authorization to “no auth”. In the Headers
section add the Content-Type of application/json and set the User-Agent to Apache-HttpClient/4.1. Copy the string retrieved in
the authentication step and then add a Cookie Key and set it to be SMAX_AUTH_TOKEN=<String from the authentication>
The Body will consist of the REST payload that needs to be sent to create something in SMAX. The body needs to be in json
format and contain all the required fields that the workflow will need.
Assuming all the required fields are present, the EMS API will return the ID of the entity that was created.
