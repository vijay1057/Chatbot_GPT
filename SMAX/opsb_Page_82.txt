Image
Aggregation
OCTCR19M1323188
Mismatch between the number of images projected (on the 
Providers
>
 
Image Aggregation Providers
 page) and the actual number of
images collected (on the 
Design
 
> Image Aggregation 
page), for a
given provider.
This occurs because of the following reasons:
1
. 
When updating the actual number of images collected on the
Design > Image Aggregation
 page, the system merges
duplicate images into single images. 
Or
2
. 
When collecting images, due to some technical issues, some of the
images may be skipped.
There is no workaround for this issue.
