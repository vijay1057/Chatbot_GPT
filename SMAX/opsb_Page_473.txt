For device-based licensing and user-based licensing, the data you see might be different. In this example, all devices that
have Office Visio installed appear in the Devices section on the right of the page.
If the license model is more complex, you can look at the 
Number of processors
 and 
Cores per processor
 columns.
This information helps you understand how each device is configured and how that could potentially impact the license
consumption points for each software license they create.

Click a device to understand how it’s consuming the product:
General tab: This page gives the same level of details shown on the previous page listing all the devices but now
specific to the device that you selected.
Deployment tab: This page gives additional details about the deployment of the software. You can see the type of
machine that has the product installed (in this example, virtual machine), the version of the software installed, and
the installation path of the software as discovered by UCMDB.
Consumption tab: This page gives details of what rule is being used and how many consumption points are used by
this device. It also gives details about the software license. If it was associated with a contract in the Contract
Management module in SMAX, it will also show the details of the contract along with start and end dates.
For products of the user-based licensing type, the user interfaces will be different. For more information, see
