TZ Environment Variable
This topic details how to set or change the TZ environment variable and update your tzdata package. If this variable is not set,
then the installer reports this issue with the identifier: 
S0305
.
Before installing 
Vertica
, update the tzdata package for your system and set the default time zone for your database
administrator account by specifying the 
TZ
 environmental variable. If your database administrator is being created by the 
insta
ll_vertica
 script, then set the 
TZ
 variable after you have installed 
Vertica
.
Update tzdata Package
The tzdata package is a public-domain time zone database that is pre-installed on most Linux systems. The tzdata package is
updated periodically for time-zone changes across the world. 
Micro Focus
recommends that you update to the latest tzdata
package before installing or updating 
Vertica
.
Update your tzdata package with the following command:
RedHat based systems: 
yum update tzdata
Debian and Ubuntu systems:
 apt-get install tzdata
Setting the Default Time Zone
When a client receives the result set of a SQL query, all rows contain data adjusted, if necessary, to the same time zone. That
time zone is the default time zone of the initiator node unless the client explicitly overrides it using the SQL 
SET TIME ZONE
command described in the 
SQL Reference Manual
. The default time zone of any node is controlled by the 
TZ 
environment
variable. If 
TZ 
is undefined, the operating system time zone.
If your operating system timezone is not set to the desired timezone of the database then make sure that the Linux
environment variable 
TZ
 is set to the desired value on all cluster hosts.
The installer returns a warning if the TZ variable is not set. If your operating system timezone is appropriate for your database,
then the operating system timezone is used and the warning can be safely ignored.
Setting the Time Zone on a Host
You can set the time zone several different ways, depending on the Linux distribution or the system administrator’s
preferences.
To set the system time zone on Red Hat and SUSE Linux systems, edit:
/etc/sysconfig/clock
To set the 
TZ
 variable, edit, 
/etc/profile
, or 
/home/dbadmin/.bashrc
 or 
/home/dbadmin/.bash_profile
 and add the following line
(for example, for the US Eastern Time Zone):
export TZ="America/New_York"
For details on which timezone names are recognized by 
Vertica
, see the appendix: 
Using Time Zones With Vertica
.
The 
TZ
 variable must be set to the same value on all nodes in the cluster.
If you explicitly set the 
TZ 
environment variable at a command line before you start the 
Administration Tools
, the
current setting will not take effect. The Administration Tools uses SSH to start copies on the other nodes, so each
time SSH is used, the 
TZ 
variable for the startup command is reset. 
TZ 
must be set in the
 .profile
 or 
.bashrc
 files
on all nodes in the cluster to take affect properly.
