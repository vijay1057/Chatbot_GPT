In addition to the SMA Evolution Toolkit, the SMAX application provides other methods of importing. Data in CSV format can be
directly imported into a table, or for more complex imports SMAX's REST API may be used. Alternatively, a middleware product
such as Connect-It may be used to move data between the products (like the SMA Evolution Toolkit does).
Service Manager and SMAX Data model considerations
Service Manager does not use the full functionality of a relational database system. Relations between tables are managed
internally in the SM Application layer. This means that the “foreign key” concept of the RDBMS is not used in the Service
Manager Database. Each record is managed individually in the corresponding entity. The consequence is that “referential
integrity checks” are not performed by the RDBMS. However, Service Manager internal validation rules to ensure that the links
between records are correctly checked. 
On the contrary, the SMAX data model is completely relational. Each record in an entity has a unique ID. Cross entity
references are built via this unique ID. However, SMAX also does NOT force referential integrity at the database level.
As a consequence, the following has to be considered when moving data records from SM to SMAX.
To ensure the re-conciliation is working properly when updating records, the SM unique key must be preserved in SMAX
when moving data. E.g. the email address of a user. Each time moving/updating data a query need to check whether that
person already exists and either create or update the record.
 When using cross entity references for example linking a location to a parent location, the solution to create/update
locations must first query the ID of the parent location prior being able to create the reference successfully.
