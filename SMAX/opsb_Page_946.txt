caCertificate

Conditional
This parameter specifies the certificates that OO requires to trust, such
as the ones used for:
The external load balancer of SMA
The OO RDS instance, only if the RDS instance can accept TLS
connections.
See below explanation for details.
The certificates that OO must trust are mandatory. You can specify these certificates in two ways:
At Helm install time via command line.
At OO install time via Helm parameter 
caCertificates
 in 
values.yaml
.
Providing these certificates via the Helm parameter 
caCertificates
 in OO 
values.yaml
 is optional. 
Regardless of the method
you chose, these certificates must be either the 
server certificates
 or the 
root CA
 that generated the server certificates. 
In
addition, the certificates must be in a 
PEM
 format (base64 encoded). 
In comparison:
The advantage of 
Option #1
 is that its faster and easier than Option #2, but it doesn't add the certificate content to the
OO values.yaml file.
The advantage of 
Option #2
 is that it adds the certificate(s) content in the OO values.yaml file which provides you with
a faster way of tracking these certificates at a later point in time, by checking the values.yaml file directly. 
Add the certificates at install time in CLI
Add the certificates at Helm install time using the 
--set-file
 arguments. 
For example: 
helm install [...] --set-file "caCertificates.smax_lb\.crt"=/path/to/smax_lb.crt --set-file "caCertificates.oo_db\.crt"=/path/to/oo_db.crt
Note that:
[...]
 is a placeholder for other Helm install related parameters. For more information, see 
Install OO Containerized on EKS
.
Make sure not to miss the escape character before the dot in the 
--set-file
 argument - eg:
"caCertificates.smax_lb
\
.crt"
You can use multiple -
-set-file
 arguments, according to the amount of certificate(s) OO requires to trust.
Add certificates using the Helm parameter
1
. 
Run the following command to add this parameter in OO values.yaml:
<OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx.xxxxx>/bin/yq e '.caCertificates = "placeholder"' -i <path/to/values.yaml>
Where:
<OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx.xxxxx>
 = installation directory of OMT
<path/to/values.yaml>
 = the path of OO values.yaml
Make sure that:
You use the command line tool 
yq
 that's part of OMT 
202x.xx
 and not from the OS 
$PATH
. The version of 
yq
 that
comes with OMT is 4.6.1, and the syntax of the command doesn't work with older versions of 
yq.

Open 
values.yaml 
in a text editor, delete "placeholder" from parameter 
caCertificates
, and specify the content of the
certificates as given below:
