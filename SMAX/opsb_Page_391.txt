changes from IdM to the agent interface.
Replication of authorization data
Automatic replication occurs in the following scenarios.
When deploying a tenant in Suite Administration
When the suite admin deploys a tenant in Suite Administration, the system replicates the following data from the agent
interface to IdM:
The out-of-the-box SMAX roles
The tenant admin user
The relationship between the tenant admin user and the Tenant Admin role.
Roles replicated from Service Management are mostly read-only in IdM. The only operation that you need to perform on such
roles is assigning permissions to capabilities other than SMAX and CMS, by using the Associated Permissions field.
When enabling DND, OO, or Native SACM in Suite Administration
When the suite admin enables DND or OO in Suite Administration, the system replicates the seeded out-of-the-box roles and
groups and the relationships between users, roles, and groups from IdM to the agent interface. As an example, the following
screenshot shows some seeded DND and OO roles replicated to the agent interface.
Caution
 The system doesn't prevent you from updating the Application field, but you shouldn't do this in IdM.
Otherwise, the data consistency between IdM and SMAX will be compromised and this will result in unexpected
behavior.
