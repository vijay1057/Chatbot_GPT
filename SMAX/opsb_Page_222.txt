Data Model
As we progress through the guide, we will investigate how the different record types in Service Management Automation X are
related, building up to a complete data model. This will provide a useful way to see how all the different modules interact with
each other. The final data model is represented in the following diagram:
In our Data Model, each box is color-coded. These colors represent the 
badge color
 for records of that type within SMAX. The
color families also help to visualize the overall modules that certain collections of records create.
Core Data
Putting the Core Data record types into our data model is a bit problematic, as they relate in some way to almost every other
record type in the system. Instead of drawing all of those lines and making our model unreadable, here we present a simplified
data model showing only the relationships between these objects.
