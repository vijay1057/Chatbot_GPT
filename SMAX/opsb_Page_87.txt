Installation
QCCR1E150235
If the external access host FQDN of the suite installation contains only
two portions (for example, myhost.mynet), you can log in to the OMT
Management Portal after the installation. However, you can't log in to
the suite.
This is a limitation of the SMA suite. Only FQDNs that contain at least
three portions (for example, myhost.mydomain.mynet) are supported.
There is no workaround for this issue.
