Service Catalog
The Catalog Structure
Now we have our services created, and the next step is to set up our service catalog. The service catalog will allow both agents
and end users to find and request what they are looking for.
The service catalog itself has three levels we need to consider:
Service category
Service definition
Offering
The Service Catalog
To consume the services IT provides, the end users need to have a way of discovering the services available and
what actions or requests they can perform against them. The service catalog provides the means of creating
those available choices for both the Service Management Automation Service Portal (accessed by the end users)
and request management (accessed by the agents).
Creating a complete service catalog can be one of the more time-consuming parts of creating the complete
Service Management Automation X implementation, but also can create the most value. A well-crafted service
catalog will reduce the manual effort needed by the Service Desk Agents by allowing the End Users to create a
well-formed request that we can automatically route to the correct groups—or even fulfill by an automated
process that never needs an agent’s intervention.

Management Automation Service Portal
