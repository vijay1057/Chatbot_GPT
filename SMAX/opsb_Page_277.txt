4. Assigning entitlement rules to the offering
The last step of the creation is to use the audience field in the offering to add an entitlement for only those users who are
agents. This stops self-service portal users from being able to see the offering. The audience can be assigned based on roles so
that only some self-service portal users can see the offerings. A new role name “Contact Creators” would be created and only
select users will be added to it.
5. Create an offering to modify contact\user information
Create an offering that will allow the agent to modify an existing contact or user. The offering will be a service offering and will
use user options and a task plan to do the updates. In this offering, people who are contacts OR users can be updated. A
person is only considered a user if they have an account in the System Administration portal and are able to login to Service
Management Automation-X.
6. Create user options in the offering
Click on the user options tab and add the user options that the request will update.
