In the production environment, you must use the external databases for the CMS application. The database user and database
name information is required when you install CMS. The database schema information is required for UCMDB Server, and Data
Flow Probe; but optional for AutoPass. A default schema name will be used if there is no new schema name assigned. 
The databases must be empty so that CMS will initialize them during installation. The table below shows example database
information prepared for the following components.
Service
DB User
DB Name
Schema 
UCMDB Server
cms_ucmdb
cms_ucmdb_db
cms_ucmdb_schema
APLS
cms_autopass
cms_autopass_db
cms_autopass_schema
Data Flow Probe 
cms_ucmdb_probe
cms_ucmdb_probe_db
cms_ucmdb_probe_schema
Below are sample SQL commands for creating a user and a database for a service:
1
. 
Log in to your PostgreSQL database server with the administrator credentials.
psql -h <host> -p <port> -U <PostgreSQL admin>
2
. 
Run the following commands to create the databases and the users used by UCMDB Server, AutoPass, and Data Flow
Probe:
CREATE USER <USERNAME> PASSWORD '<PASSWORD>';
CREATE DATABASE <DBNAME> OWNER <USERNAME>;
For example:
# For UCMDB
CREATE USER cms_ucmdb PASSWORD '<PASSWORD>';
CREATE DATABASE cms_ucmdb_db OWNER cms_ucmdb;
# 
For APLS 
CREATE USER cms_autopass PASSWORD '<PASSWORD>';
CREATE DATABASE cms_autopass_db OWNER cms_autopass;
# For Data Flow Probe
CREATE USER cms_ucmdb_probe PASSWORD '<PASSWORD>';
CREATE DATABASE cms_ucmdb_probe_db OWNER cms_ucmdb_probe;
 
3
. 
Run the following commands to create the schemas used by UCMDB Server, and Data Flow Probe: 
\c <DBNAME>
CREATE SCHEMA <DBSCHEMA> AUTHORIZATION <USERNAME>;
ALTER USER <USERNAME> SET search_path TO <DBSCHEMA>;
For example:
# For UCMDB
\c cms_ucmdb_db
CREATE SCHEMA cms_ucmdb_schema AUTHORIZATION cms_ucmdb;
ALTER USER cms_ucmdb SET search_path TO cms_ucmdb_schema;
Probe.
Note 
<PASSWORD>
 for the database user meet the following complexity requirements defined by the
Micro Focus Vault secret utility:
Length: at least 8 characters
Alpha numeric characters
At least 1 lower case letter
At least 1 upper case letter
At least 1 digit
