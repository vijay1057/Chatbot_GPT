If you do not perform this step, you may receive error messages that state that OMT environment variables (such as 
K8S_
HOME
) don't exist in the current shell.
If you receive some errors while you run the installation commands, see the "Troubleshoot installation " topic for the
troubleshooting details. You can also check the installation log under the 
$TMP_FOLDER 
directory.
After you have fixed the errors, run the installation commands again to continue the OMT installation. However, when you re-
run the installation command, make sure you use the same installation command with the same options and configurations.
The 
install
 script automatically runs a precheck before deploying the nodes. However, if you want to run a standalone precheck
on the control plane node, see the "Perform preliminary checks" topic.
