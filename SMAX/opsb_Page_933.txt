Launch RDS for OO
OO Containerized uses Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) to store its data.
There are two options for setting up Amazon RDS for OO:
(Recommended) Use a dedicated Amazon RDS instance for OO to ensure a smooth and fluent experience.
Use the same Amazon RDS instance as the rest of the suite components.
Irrespective of the choice, review the 
sizing considerations
 to check the Amazon RDS requirements.
For option #1:
Perform all the following steps:
Prepare Amazon RDS template for OO
 
Create an Amazon RDS instance for OO
Create databases for OO on the Amazon RDS instance
For option #2:
You must resize the shared Amazon RDS instance to an instance type capable of supporting the added requirements
of both suite and OO.
Perform the step 
Create databases for OO on the Amazon RDS instance.
 
Prepare Amazon RDS template for OO
Copy and save the following as 
oo-rds.template
. Upload it later in the
 AWS Console
