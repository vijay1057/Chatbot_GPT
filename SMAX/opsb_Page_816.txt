                "config:DescribeConfigurationRecorders"

Click 
Review policy
 and give a name to this policy. For example, 
sma-aws-policy
.
d
. 
Click 
Create policy
. Wait until a message appears, indicating you have created the policy.
Step 2: Attach the policy to a user or role.
AWS provides multiple ways to attach the policy to a user, here are two possible methods below. 
Method 1:
If you want a specific IAM user in your account to be the operator. In this scenario, each user can have their own password to
access the AWS Management Console. 
Click 
Users
 and follow these steps to attach the policy to your user account:
1
. 
Click the chosen user account from the user list.
2
. 
Click 
Add permissions
 > 
Attach existing policies directly
.
3
. 
Select the user policy created in the previous step and click 
Next: Review
.
4
. 
Click 
Add permissions
 and wait till a message appears, indicating you have attached the policy. If you don't have the
required permissions to attach the user policy, contact your AWS administrators.
Method 2:
If you want a federated user to be the operator. 
In this scenario, your company has its own corporate directory to provide single-sign-on 'SSO' access to the AWS Management
Console for your users.
1
. 
Create a role for the federated users and attach the prepared policy to it. See 
Creating a role for federation
.
2
. 
Switch to the role. See 
switching roles
.
If the above methods do not suit your needs, you can refer to the 
AWS official guide
 for more options or contact AWS support
for assistance.
Create a key pair on AWS
Before proceeding, you also need to allocate an FQDN for the suite (for example, via AWS route 53 services by following the
AWS document
) and create a key pair on AWS (see the 
AWS document
) if you don't have one in the selected region.

AWS IAM
.
Important
 Once you log in to the AWS Management Console, you can select a region at the upper-right
corner. You must place all the created resources in the same region to prevent performance issues, including VPC,
EKS cluster, EFS, RDS, and bastion. Some regions don't support the availability of all the required resources. We
recommend that you read instructions at 
Geographical distribution of AWS
 before you select a region.
