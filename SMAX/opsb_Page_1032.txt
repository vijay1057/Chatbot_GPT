After installing the PostgreSQL client on the bastion you can perform either of the below steps:
Run the following command to check the database:
psql "host=<fqdn of flexible server> port=5432 dbname=postgres user=<postgres_admin> password=<password for admin> sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=<full path of the root CA certificate>"
Use pgAdmin and use the bastion as the SSH Tunnel. With pgAdmin4 version 6.5+, you can do this by configuring the
SSH Tunnel.
Note:
 If you want to use a plain connection instead of TLS to the flexible server, you can go to Server parameters and use
require_secure_transport to turn off the SSL force.
Set up a PostgreSQL database for OMT API Server on the flexible server
Role
Location
Suite administrator
Bastion node
In a production environment, you must create an external PostgreSQL database for the OMT API Server exclusively. To do this,
later you will need to specify the related options while you run the 
install
 command (see 
Deploy bootstrap
).
Follow the steps below to set up the non-public schema external PostgreSQL database, as OMT doesn't support public schema
for the external PostgreSQL database. This requires database administrator credentials When creating the Azure Flexible
Server instance, you have already specified an administrator account, which is referred to as 
<postgres_admin> 
in the
steps below.
1
. 
Log in to the bastion node and then run the following command to connect to the PostgreSQL instance. Replace <postgres
admin> with the actual value.
psql "host=<fqdn of flexible server> port=5432 dbname=postgres user=<
postgres_admin
> password=<password for admin> sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=<full path of the root CA certificate>"
2
. 
Run the following commands:
CREATE USER cdfapiserver login PASSWORD 'mypassword';
grant cdfapiserver to <postgres admin>;
CREATE DATABASE cdfapiserverdb WITH owner=cdfapiserver;
\c cdfapiserverdb;
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO cdfapiserver;
ALTER SCHEMA public RENAME TO cdfapiserver;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA cdfapiserver from public;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA cdfapiserver to cdfapiserver; 
ALTER USER cdfapiserver SET search_path TO cdfapiserver;
The example commands above perform the following operations:
creating an external database and a user for OMT API Server
changing the public schema and revoking the public role of the database
setting 
search_path
 from public to non-public
cdfapiserver
 is the database login user name. Replace it with your actual value. 
mypassword
 is the database login password. Replace it with your actual value. Make sure the password is wrapped
in single quotes.
cdfapiserverdb
 is the database name. Replace it with your actual value. 
3
. 
Make sure the external database is empty, which means the database doesn't contain any database objects, such as
tables, procedures, and views.
4
. 
When your database is ready, make a record of the following information. You will need this information during the
installation at the 
Deploy bootstrap
 step.
Database user
Database user's password
Database URL, which consists of the database host, port, and database name. 
Database root CA certificate
For example:
--db-user cdfapiserver \
--db-password mypassword \
--db-url jdbc:postgresql://mypghost.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/cdfapiserverdb \
--db-crt /home/centos/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt \
Prepare for the automatic creation of PostgreSQL databases for OMT IdM and the suite
on the flexible server
During the OMT installation, the installation portal UI will let you choose an 
out-of-the-box
 PostgreSQL or
an 
external
 PostgreSQL for the OMT IdM. You must use an external database for the OMT IdM in a production
environment. For an external PostgreSQL, the installation portal provides two options for configuring an external PostgreSQL
Note
: If the second command above fails, run 
sudo yum install update
 , and then rerun the failed command.
