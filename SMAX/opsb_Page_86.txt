OMT
OCTCR19M1187639
OMT doesn't support SSL connections to the native Google PostgreSQL
database in deployments on GKE. The native Google PostgreSQL server
certificate doesn't include the required IP/FQDN for SSL connections to
the native Google PostgreSQL database. Therefore, the connection (with
sslmode=verify-full) can't be validated and the installation fails.
See the workaround.

Repeating errors "Orphaned pod found" are flooding the syslog on the
control plane nodes and worker nodes. The repeating errors resemble
the following:
Orphaned pod "06e07ca9-b83c-11e9-ae33-005056b36f84" found, but volume subpat
hs are still present on disk : There were a total of 24 errors similar to this. 
Turn up verbosity to see them. 
Note
: This issue exists only in an embedded Kubernetes environment.

QCCR1E157063
After you submit a request bundle that includes more than 3 requests in
Service Portal, some child requests of the request bundle stop
responding in the

 phase, instead of proceeding
to 
Approval
 or 
Fulfillment
 phase as expected.

of Service Portal and tries to log in again, no authentication page is
displayed and the user can directly access Service Portal. No such issue
occurs in Firefox and Chrome.

Service Portal
QCCR1E149117
When you try to log in to Service Portal, the following error occurs:
Server Error. Please try to refresh, or come back in a few minutes.
This issues happens when the itom-xruntime-gateway service is
restarted at the backend. When the service is recreated, it's assigned a
new IP address by Kubernetes. However, Nginx in itom-xruntime-ui
doesn't pick up the new IP address of itom-xruntime-gateway and still
attempts to connect to the old IP address.
See the workaround
