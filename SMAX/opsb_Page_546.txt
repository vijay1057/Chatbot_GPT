Note
: CGRO needs a Vertica database.
Calculate the capability deployment sizes
The following are size definitions for the SMA, SAM, and DND capabilities, and sizing considerations for the CGRO capability. 
SMA size definitions
During the installation, you will need to select a deployment size: 
Small
, 
Medium
, or
 Large
, so that the suite installer
automatically scales the suite deployment according to the selected size. Use the following table to calculate your deployment
size.

users (including
both Service Portal
users and IT agent
users)

Concurrent users are active users who have logged in to the system to
perform operations and consume system resources. There are two types of
concurrent users: service portal users and IT agent users. The workload for
each type of users is as follows:
Service portal users: After logging in to the system, each portal user
has a session duration of about 30 minutes on the system. They create
1 ~ 2 orders or requests.
IT agent users: IT agent users have a longer session duration, and each
of them is active for about 1.5 hours after login and handles 4 ~ 6
tickets.
Calculate the business operation throughput based on the workload
assumption described earlier in this topic. For example, for 400 service
portal users, the number of newly created orders or requests will be 800 ~
1600 per hour, while for 400 IT agent users, the number of handled tickets
will be 1000 ~ 1600 per hour. If you have a much larger business operation
throughput than the numbers provided here, consider adding more worker
nodes.
User count conversion
:
The user count numbers assume that you will have only SMAX tenant
users. Conduct user count conversion if you plan to deploy both SMAX
tenants and Service Manager tenants. 
In general, 1 Service Manager user is equal to 0.7 SMAX users, because a
Service Manager tenant consumes only Service Portal in the container.
Example
: If your SMA deployment needs to support 400 Service Manager
tenant concurrent users and 100 SMAX tenant concurrent users. , the actual
user count is: 400 X 0.7 + 100 = 380. So you need to select the Small size.
