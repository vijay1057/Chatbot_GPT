Service Instance
A subscription originates with a subscription request, which is a request for delivery of cloud services that are initiated by the
subscriber (end-user) using a catalog in the Service Portal. After a subscription request is approved, a service instance is
created. The system constructs service instance artifacts during service deployment and updates service instances during
service management. Service instances provide all details of the deployed service and its components; for example,
provisioned IP details for a network segment component. Service instances are based on the service design configured for the
service offering, and on consumer demand.
