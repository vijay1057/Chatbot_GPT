echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled
Enabling Transparent Hugepages on Red Hat 7/8, CentOS 7/8, 
SUSE 15.1, and Amazon
Linux 2.0
Determine if transparent hugepages is enabled. To do so, run the following command.
cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
[always] madvise never
The setting returned in brackets is your current setting.
For systems that do not support 
/etc/rc.local
, use the equivalent startup script that is run after the destination runlevel has been
reached. For example SuSE uses 
/etc/init.d/after.local
.
You can enable transparent hugepages by editing 
/etc/rc.local
 and adding the following script:
if test -f /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled; then
    echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
fi
You must reboot your system for the setting to take effect, or, as root, run the following echo line to proceed with the install
without rebooting:
# echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
If you are using Red Hat 7.0 or CentOS 7.0 or higher, run the following command as root or sudo:
$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local
Disabling Transparent Hugepages on Other Systems
To determine if transparent hugepages is enabled, run the following command.
cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
[always] madvise never
The setting returned in brackets is your current setting. Depending on your platform OS, the 
madvise
 setting may not be
displayed.
You can disable transparent hugepages one of two ways:
Edit your boot loader (for example 
/etc/grub.conf
). Typically, you add the following to the end of the kernel line. However,
consult the documentation for your system before editing your bootloader configuration.
transparent_hugepage=never
Edit 
/etc/rc.local
 (on systems that support rc.local) and add the following script.
if test -f /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled; then
   echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
fi
For systems that do not support 
/etc/rc.local
, use the equivalent startup script that is run after the destination runlevel has been
reached. For example SuSE uses 
/etc/init.d/after.local
.
Regardless of which approach you choose, you must reboot your system for the setting to take effect, or run the following two
echo lines to proceed with the install without rebooting:
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
Note
SUSE did not offer transparent hugepage support in its initial 11.0 release. However, subsequent SUSE service
packs do include support for transparent hugepages.
