OMT Tools capability includes a support tool that gathers the data discussed in the “Logs” chapter and adds additional data.
The tool is located in <installation directory>/tools/support-tool and is called support-dump.
Tool output
The compressed file that the support tool generates is encrypted and password-protected with a chosen password:
<installation directory>/tools/support-tool/dmp/support_data_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.aes
It can be made readable again using the following command:
dd if=<filename>.aes |openssl aes-256-ecb -d -k <your_password>|tar zxf -
