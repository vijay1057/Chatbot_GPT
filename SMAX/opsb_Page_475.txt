Budget control using the Financial Management module
Following a budget or spending plan helps an organization make full use of the buying and investing opportunities. The
Financial Management module allows you to plan, execute, monitor, and control your budgets and expenditure in an efficient
and effective way.
This use case provides step-by-step instructions on how to manage your financial resources by comparing the actual
expenditure incurred to the planned budget. With the budget and expense information, you can identify the corrective actions
that are required to reach your financial goals.
Concepts
Here, we list some key concepts for you to get started:
Fiscal year: enables you to specify a 12-month period as a fiscal year for your company
Accounting period: enables you to specify any period of time within a fiscal year to cover a set of financial statements
Budget center: enables you to manage and analyze the budgets and their allocation in an organization
Budget: enables you to create, maintain, and track your budgeted costs
Budget type: defines the different kinds of budgets based on common characteristics
Cost center: aggregates the actual cost incurred in an organization
Cost type: categorizes the expense types from a financial perspective
Budget line: defines the amount of planned expenditure for some budget types in a given accounting period
Expense line: enables you to track and manage costs, both incurred or projected
