We can define the maintenance and blackout time periods to correspond to every service we have or only a specific service.
When creating or reviewing a change, the requester will see the blackout and maintenance windows, which will assist them in
the scheduling process. In fact, Service Management Automation X can even suggest a start time based on the duration of the
change and the maintenance windows defined.
Additional information about time periods may be found
