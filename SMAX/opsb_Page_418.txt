redefinition of a service to type nodePort.
For example, to access the OMT AppHub Management Portal, an Ingress definition is created. Run: 
kubectl describe ing mng-portal 
-n core
Name:             mng-portal
Namespace:        core
Address:
Default backend:  default-http-backend:80 (<none>)
TLS:
  nginx-default-secret terminates hostname.mycompany.com
Rules:
  Host                  Path  Backends
  ----                  ----  --------
  hostname.mycompany.com
                        /mngPortal   mng-portal:80 (<none>)
                        /            mng-portal:80 (<none>)
Annotations:
  ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors:                 true
  ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target:              /
  ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends:             true
  kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration:  {"apiVersion":"extensions/v1beta1","kind":"Ingress","metadata":{"annotations":{"ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors":"true","ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target":"/","ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends":"true"},"name":"mng-portal","namespace":"core"},"spec":{"rules":[{"host":"hostname.mycompany.com","http":{"paths":[{"backend":{"serviceName":"mng-portal","servicePort":80},"path":"/mngPortal"},{"backend":{"serviceName":"mng-portal","servicePort":80},"path":"/"}]}}],"tls":[{"hosts":["hostname.mycompany.com"],"secretName":"nginx-default-secret"}]}}
Events:  <none>
Both the / and /mngPortal URLs will redirect traffic to the mng-portal service port 80.
TLS termination happens at the Ingress layer.
The mng-portal service is defined as follows. Run: 
kubectl describe svc mng-portal -n core
Name:              mng-portal
Namespace:         core
Labels:            app=mng-portal
Annotations:       kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration:
                     {"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"Service","metadata":{"annotations":{},"labels":{"app":"mng-portal"},"name":"mng-portal","namespace":"core"},"sp...
Selector:          app=mng-portal
Type:              ClusterIP
IP:                172.17.17.246
Port:              <unset>  80/TCP
TargetPort:        9090/TCP
Endpoints:         172.16.63.19:9090
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
The service itself is of type ClusterIP so only visible externally when explicitly described by an Ingress rule.
The cluster internal IP is 172.17.17.246.
The actual Management Portal service is running inside a Pod with IP address 172.16.63.19 on port 9090.
Ingress for suites components is configured in the same way.
Egress
All containers can talk to the outside world. They're only limited by firewall and network rules at the host and host network(s)
level. Kubernetes network policies are not supported on OMT embedded Kubernetes.
Name resolution (DNS)
When a customer DNS resolution is available
Inside the cluster, a container resolves a DNS names as follows:
"<namespace>.svc.cluster.local",
"svc.cluster.local",
"cluster.local",
"<search in host /etc/resolv.conf>"
So if a container running in Kubernetes namespace “suite1” wants to talk to service svc1, then it will try the following path:
svc1.suite1.svc.cluster.local",
svc1.svc.cluster.local",
svc1.cluster.local",
svc1.<prefix(es)> from search statement in host /etc/resolv.conf
When a customer DNS resolution isn't available
Note
OMT Apphub and ITOM suites use Ingress rules and Ingress controller and also expose their functionality via
nodePort-type services or a combination of both.
