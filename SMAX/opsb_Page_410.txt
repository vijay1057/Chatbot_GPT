Figure - Sample application deployment
(*) During the transition phase from legacy monoliths to containerized deployment it's likely that some parts of the Suite
installation still consist of classic installations. This hybrid mode will be addressed over time as the Suite components are re-
architected so they can be deployed and run as a set of containerized microservices.
Some suites may expose functionality directly via Kubernetes node ports. During the suite deployment, when a Kubernetes
node port is created, the specified service will be available for access on the same port on every cluster node.
Suite installation - Helm
The steps to install OMT AppHub and one or more ITOM suites are as follows.
Without embedded Kubernetes
Deploy/prepare an external Kubernetes instance
Download and unpack the OMT compressed archive.
Download and unpack the installation metadata for the ITOM Suite
(Optionally) Bootstrap OMT AppHub into the external Kubernetes cluster.
Create a new deployment to hold the ITOM suite
Run the Helm chart install to install the ITOM suite using the OMT AppHub or Helm CLI.
Refer to the Suite installation/administration guide for complete package prerequisites.

With embedded Kubernetes
Prepare Linux systems for installation
Download and unpack the OMT compressed archive.
Copy the bootstrap installation files to the 1
st
 control plane node.
Configure the installation for control plane and worker nodes using the install.properties file and/or installation command
line options.
Configure an installation options file for silent install.
On the 1
st
 control plane node, start the OMT installation. This will install a complete yet empty Kubernetes cluster with
selected OMT capabilities.
Create a new deployment to hold the ITOM suite
Run the Helm chart install to install the ITOM suite using the OMT AppHub or Helm CLI.
Refer to the Suite installation/administration guide for complete package prerequisites.
