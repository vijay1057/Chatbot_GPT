kubectl delete -f itom-audit-pv.yaml
Clean the EFS volumes
Log on to the Elastic File System (EFS) server host and clear all the contents in the EFS volume directories that you created.
For example:
rm -rf /var/vols/itom/audit/auditns/vault/*
rm -rf /var/vols/itom/audit/auditns/log/*

The Audit uninstallation process doesn't remove the databases from the external PostgreSQL server. You need to remove the
databases manually.
