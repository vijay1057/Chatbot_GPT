You can use “hostssl” instead of "host" if your PostgreSQL database server has SSL enabled, but this is optional for
the suite installation. For information about the difference between “host” and “hostssl”, see the 
PostgreSQL
documentation
. In order for the suite to connect to PostgreSQL through SSL, you only need to enable the TLS option
and import your PostgreSQL CA certificate into the suite from the installation portal UI in a later step when
configuring database connection settings for the suite.
<dba_user>: replace it with the DBA user name of the PostgreSQL server. You will specify this user later on the
installation portal UI. 
172.0.0.0/24: this is an example value used in this step and some of the next steps. You need to replace this
example value with the IPv4 address range of the cluster nodes or a single cluster node's hostname.

Add the following line to the pg_hba.conf file to allow the maas_admin user to access the default 
postgres
 database:
host postgres maas_admin 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256 
This configuration is needed because before creating the SMA component databases, the suite installer will check if they
already exist, and will skip the database creation if they already exist. To check the existence of the databases, the suite
installer will use the mass_admin user to connect to the default 
postgres
 database.

If you want to deploy the DND capability, add the following lines to the pg_hba.conf file:
host dnd hcm_admin 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256
host postgres hcm_admin 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256
host dnd <dba_user> 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256

If you want to deploy the SAM capability, add the following lines to the 
pg_hba.conf
 file:
host sam sam
 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256
host sam <dba_user> 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256

If you want to deploy the CGRO capability, add the following lines to the 
pg_hba.conf
 file:
host cgro cgro
 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256
host cgro <dba_user> 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256

. 
Run the following commands on the PostgreSQL host to check the 
DefaultTasksMax
 value:
systemctl show --property DefaultTasksMax
systemctl status <postgresql.service name> | grep Task
Where: <postgresql.service name> refers to the PostgreSQL service name in your environment, which may vary from one
PostgreSQL installation to another (an example of the service name is 
postgresql.service
). If the 
DefaultTasksMax
value is too small (for example, the 
DefaultTasksMax
 property has a default value of 512 on SUSE), your connection to
the PostgreSQL database may fail with the following error: 
could not fork new process for connection: Resource temporarily unavaila
ble
. To prevent this issue from occurring, you need to add the following line to the
/usr/lib/systemd/system/<postgresql.service name> file:
TasksMax=1000000
Note
: Normally this step isn't needed if PostgreSQL is running on RHEL, CentOS, or Oracle Linux.

Restart PostgreSQL. 
Install and configure Vertica for CGRO
To use CGRO, in addition to the PostgreSQL configuration described above, you still need to install and configure a Vertica
database. For details, see 
Install and configure Vertica database
.
