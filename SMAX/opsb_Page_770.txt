Upload container images for Audit to a registry
Upload the installation images to your image registry. The image registry is a local registry on your cluster nodes or an
external registry, such as your enterprise repository.
To upload the images:
1
. 
Log on to the control plane node where you downloaded or copied the images.
2
. 
Run the following command to the 
$CDF_HOME/scripts/
 directory:
cd $CDF_HOME/scripts
3
. 
Run the following command to upload the suite images to the local registry:
./uploadimages.sh [-r <image repository URL> -u <username> -d <image download directory> -o <org name>]
Where:
<image repository URL>
: Specify the 
-r
 option if you want to upload the images to an external registry other than
the local registry.
Replace <
username
> with the registry username.  Use the 
registry-admin
 user for the local registry. The local
registry refers to the default registry or the registry URL that's 
localhost:5000
.
If you don't specify the credentials here, you can specify when prompted while running the command.
<image download directory>
: The directory where the container images will get downloaded. The default value is
/var/opt/cdf/offline. The 
-d
 option is the image directory where you placed the images you have downloaded. Specify
the 
-d 
option if the images aren't available in the 
/var/opt/cdf/offline/
 directory. You can use the 
-d
 option multiple
times when the images are in different directories. However, if you have specified the 
-l
 option to "false", then you
can only specify one image directory. The images can be the images download by the 
downloadimages.sh
. Only
the .tar, .tgz, and .tar.gz images are supported. Make sure the image file type matches the file extension. 
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, this is 
hpeswit
om.
 This option is mandatory if you aren't using the default organization name.
To see the full list of options for the 
uploadimages.sh
 command, run the following command:
./uploadimages.sh -h 
For example:
./uploadimages.sh -y -c 4 -u registry-admin
The 
-p
 option is the password of the "
registry-admin
" user. The initial value of the "
registry-admin
" password is the
password you set while you run the 
install
 to install OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT). You can also change the 
registry-
admin
 password with the script 
$CDF_HOME/scripts/updateLocalRegistryInfo.sh
.

Wait until the images are successfully uploaded. Your terminal resembles the following:
Upload-process successfully completed.
