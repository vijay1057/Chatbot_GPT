Hardware requirements for option 2: SMA SAM CMS
If you plan to use deployment option 2 (
SMA
 with 
SAM
 and 
Native SACM
 enabled), you need to determine the hardware
resources required for both SMA and CMS by following these two steps.
Step 1: Determine the hardware requirements for SMA
Determine the hardware requirements for the SMA and SAM capabilities, according to the 
SMA
 and 
SAM
 size definitions.

.
Step 2: Plan additional hardware resources for CMS
Plan the additional hardware resources required for CMS according to whether you will use a classic CMS or the containerized
CMS. For details, see 
Additional hardware requirements for CMS
.

Plan the deployment
(Optional) Install containerized CMS (on-premises)
Note
 
The following table assumes both capabilities have the same size. If the two capabilities have different
deployment sizes, see 
Hardware requirements for other options
 instead.

Tip
  You can deploy SMA and CMS in different deployment sizes. For SMA in 
large
 size, you can deploy CMS
in 
medium
 size.
