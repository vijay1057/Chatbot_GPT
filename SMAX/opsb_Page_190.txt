Reporting on Service Targets
It will be very important for us to report on how we are performing against our service agreements. Service Management
Automation X stores all the data we need to determine what kind of job we are doing against each one.
One thing we need to think about as we design our reports is what we are measuring in each one. Are we looking at how we
are doing in a specific area, such as incidents or requests? Or are we looking at a specific type of target (the approvals target
type in a request for example)?
The reason this is important is that we will report against a different data set depending on the answer to that question. If we
want to see all the incidents that have breached any service target, we will report against the incident table. If instead, we
want to see how many approval target type breaches we have; I need to report against the actual service level target data.
So as long as we know what we are trying to measure we can select the correct record type to report against. This way we can
get all the information we need into our reports and/or dashboards.
