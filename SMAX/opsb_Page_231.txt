Managed Service Provider (MSP) Mode
Service Management Automation X provides the ability for shared services providers to manage their business units' and/or
clients' request and incident records in a single interface using the multi-tenant (MT) console.
Each customer/business unit can use their own tenant but allow the “parent” to have direct access to the tickets from a
consolidated view.
The MT console requires the Tenants to be set up in a specific way, and then Agents to be given appropriate permission to the
MT console and “child” tenants.
If an agent has been granted the permissions on a specific managed tenant, when the agent clicks on an Individual record in
the MT console, the record opens in a separate tab, and the agent is then inside that specific tenant.
