Security
OMT embedded Kubernetes, AppHub and other application installations leverage and/or employ various techniques for tight
security control:
Host firewall
SE Linux on the cluster node
Linux kernel process isolation features
Container users and privileges
Host directory / file permissions
Containerd configuration
Kubernetes configuration
Certificate-secured communication
Dedicated secure configuration store and certificate generation: Hashicorp Vault
OMT AppHub user management
Host firewall
The host firewall can be up and running during and after OMT embedded Kubernetes is installed.
Applications can be installed with the host firewall running.
SELinux
Host-level
Host-level SELinux can be in either “disabled”, “permissive” or “enforcing” mode for installation and runtime of the OMT
embedded Kubernetes.
OMT installs SE Linux policy modules to allow components to work when SE Linux is running in "enforcing" mode.
It's possible that on certain customer configurations, security exceptions will be caught, thereby possibly causing one or more
components not to work properly. In such case, a support ticket can be opened so Micro Focus can address the limitation
through an updated policy module.
Containerd-level
OMT embedded Kubernetes doesn't support reconfiguring the Containerd daemon to enable SELinux support using the
enable_selinux setting in /path/to/cfg/containerd-config.toml.
Linux kernel process isolation features
The basis of container security is provided by several Linux kernel isolation features:
namespaces: 
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html
cgroups: 
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html
chroots: 
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html
Containerd uses the above Linux kernel features to provide secure and isolated execution of application processes inside
containers.
The remainder of this chapter focuses on the specific OMT security configuration.
Container users and privileges
Users
Containers 
typically
 don't use the root user inside the container.
They use a regular user account and group inside the container, defined when the container image is built.
This non-privileged user is then used to start all the processes inside the container.
Below example shows a typical suite container, showing output of the ‘id’ command and running processes:
sh-4.3$ id
uid=495(bvd) gid=493(bvd) groups=493(bvd)
sh-4.3$ ps -ef
UID PID PPID C STIME TTY TIME CMD
bvd 1 0 0 Apr12 ? 00:03:15 /bin/node /bvd/server.js control
bvd 180 0 0 11:42 ? 00:00:00 sh
bvd 197 180 0 11:45 ? 00:00:00 ps -ef
OMT AppHub uses the root user only where technically required. If not technically required, OMT AppHub containers use a
regular user.
“Technically required” explained:
Micro Focus uses off the shelf open source images and the container user is set as root and can't be changed
