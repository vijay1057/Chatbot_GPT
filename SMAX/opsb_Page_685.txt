TLS 1.2
If the PostgreSQL database server requires TLS connections, perform the following
steps:
1
. 
Select the 
TLS 1.2
 option.
2
. 
Upload your PostgreSQL CA certificate file (in PEM format) to the suite. The CA
certificate can be single-level or multi-level. If multi-level, the CA certificate must
include the entire CA certificate chain (that is, the root CA certificate, second CA
certificate, and third CA certificate). To upload the PostgreSQL CA certificate file,
either drag the file from your local drive to the box or browse to the file.
3
. 
Wait until the file upload is complete.
4
. 
Select an SSL mode from the list:
verify-ca
: the client will verify that the server is trustworthy by checking
the certificate chain up to a trusted certificate authority (CA).
verify-full
: the client will also verify that the server hostname matches the
common name in the server certificate. The SSL connection will fail if the
server certificate can't be verified. This mode is recommended in most
security-sensitive environments.
Notes
:
By deselecting the 
TLS
 
1.2
 option, you are disabling or bypassing security
features, thereby exposing the system to increased security risks. By using the
non-TLS option, you understand and agree to assume all associated risks and
hold 
Micro Focus
 harmless for the same.
You have the option to enable PostgreSQL SSL after the installation. For details,
see 
Enable SSL connections to external PostgreSQL after suite installation

Repeat the steps above to create more database configurations if you like.

. 
Check that the screen displays a list of database configurations that you have created.
5
. 
For each suite component, select a database configuration from the drop-down list. When done, click 
Test
 to make sure
that you can successfully connect to the database servers.
Note that if you specify an unsupported database, the database connection test will fail.
6
. 
For each suite component, the suite installer will automatically create one or more databases and a database owner on
the specified external PostgreSQL database server. Each database is created in a private schema. The following table lists
these automatically created databases and database owners.
On the Suite Database Owner Settings page, you need to specify an initial password for all these database owners.
