The SMA suite leverages an 
AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
 to distribute the incoming traffic across different
targets.
You first need to create an 
AWS Load Balancer Controller
. It will automatically provision an ALB when you create an
Ingress for port 3000. Later you will need to create Ingress resources for ports 443 and 5443 respectively, which are bound
to the same ALB.
These three ports are used for the following purposes:
Port 3000: used to access the installation portal
Port 5443: used to access the OMT management portal
Port 443: used to access the suite
Step 1: Create AWS Load Balancer Controller
The AWS load balancer controller helps to manage load balancers for a Kubernetes cluster. It will provision a load balancer for
you when you create an Ingress.
Important
 The Application Load Balancer (ALB) you will create will be provisioned automatically and managed
by EKS. Please do not configure anything on the ALB manually.
