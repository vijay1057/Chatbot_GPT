Download the container images
If you have specified the external image registry URL while you run the 
install
 script, all the required images have been
downloaded and uploaded. You don't need to perform the download and upload steps.
If you didn't specify the external image registry URL while you run the 
install
 script, you must download the suite images from
the image registry and import them to a local registry. When the control plane node doesn't have public Internet access (either
directly or through a proxy), you must prepare an additional Linux download machine that can access the public Internet to
download the images.
Steps if you already downloaded the container images
If you have already downloaded the container images, follow these steps:
1
. 
When you reach the the 
Download Images
 page, run the 
$CDF_HOME/scripts/uploadimages.sh 
script
 
to upload the suite
images to the local registry. 
2
. 
Return to the installation portal, and then click 
Next
. 
3
.

If any of the control plane nodes can access Docker Hub directly, right-click the 
Get the download script
package
 link, and then copy the link address. On the control plane node, run the following command to download the
script package directly to the control plane node:
 
wget <pasted_link_to_script_package>
If none of the control plane nodes can access Docker Hub, click the 
Get the download script package
 link to download
the 
offline-download.zip
 file to your localhost. Then, transfer the 
offline-download.zip
 file to a download machine that can
access Docker Hub. You will later download the images to this download machine.

 This topic contains legacy terms that aren't yet fully removed from OMT. Instances of “master” in this
topic refer to the control plane or to the control plane nodes.
Note: 
If some images are missing from the registry but you can't download them now (for example, if you
are experiencng network issues), you can select the 
Ignore
 option, and then click 
NEXT
 to continue the
infrastructure deployment. However, you won't be able to install the suite until all required images are in the
local registry. To do this, follow the steps in the "Start to download the suite images" topic. When you have
downloaded the images, follow the steps in the "Upload the images" section below.
