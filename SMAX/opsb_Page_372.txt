(the default Gmail IMAP and SMTP ports). If there are connection issues, open a command window and try to telnet into the
ports. If this is not possible, the integration will not be possible from this machine. The primary cause of the ports not
appearing open is a firewall between the OPB machine and the Internet.
 
Downloading the OPB configuration file
There are two steps to installing the On-Premises Bridge. First, download the OPB connection file. Second, download the
installation binary (covered in the next section). To download the OPB connection file, open the Service Management
Automation X UI and then navigate to 
Admin-> integration->Agents
. Click on the ‘Add agent’ button to launch the new
agent form. Enter a name for the agent and then click on the ‘Download Connection File’ button. Once clicked, a file with the
information on how to connect to this specific tenant will be downloaded. The connection file is unique per tenant and has
information including the agent name, tenant number, and farm location. After downloading the file, it will need to be copied to
the machine where the OPB will be installed. The configuration file is named 
server-connection.conf
.
Downloading the OPB installation binary
The On-Premises Bridge agent installation is available for download from the Service Management Automation X UI on
the 
Admin -> Integration Management -> Agents
 page. Then click on the ‘Download agent’ button. The agent is ~300mb
in size and may require several minutes to download. The file is named 
opb-installation.exe
. 
Installing the OPB
Copy the installation binary downloaded previously to the machine that it will be installed on and double click to launch.
