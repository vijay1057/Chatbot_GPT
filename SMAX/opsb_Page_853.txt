main(){
  checkPreTools
  cleanup
  preparePolicy
  prepareOIDC
  createServiceAccount
  createALBcontroller
}
main
After saving the above script, run the following commands to create the load balancer controller.  
chmod +x createALBcontroller.sh 
./createALBcontroller.sh   [-r|--region <awsRegion>] [-c|--cluster <clusterName>]
Where:
-r|--region
: Represents the region that same as your EKS cluster.
-c|--cluster
: Represents the name of your EKS cluster. 
Step 2: Prepare a certificate for Application Load Balancer
Before creating an ALB, you need to allocate an FQDN for the suite (for example, via AWS route 53 services by following
the 
AWS document
) if you don't have one. You also need to prepare a certificate for the ALB using 
one of
 the following
methods. Or else, unexpected errors may occur at later steps.
Request a certificate
If you want to request a new certificate, follow these steps:
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console in your target region.
2
. 
Navigate to 
All services
 > 
Security, Identity, & Compliance
 > 
Certificate Manager
.
3
. 
If the 
firstrun
 page is displayed, click 
Get Started
.
4
. 
Click 
Request a certificate
.
5
. 
Select 
Request a public certificate
 and click 
Request a certificate
.
6
. 
Specify your target domain name. Use an asterisk (*) to request a wildcard certificate to protect several sites in the same
domain. For example, 
*.testsma-ng.org
.
7
. 
Click 
Next
.
8
. 
Select 
DNS validation
 or 
Email validation
 according to your permission.
9
. 
Click 
Review
 and then click 
Confirm and request
.
10
. 
Click 
Continue
.
11
. 
Finish the certificate validation based on the method you just selected. For more information,
see 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/acm/validation
.
Import a certificate
If you want to use a customized certificate, follow these steps:
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console in your target region.
2
. 
Navigate to 
All services
 > 
Security, Identity, & Compliance
 > 
Certificate Manager
.
3
. 
If the 
firstrun
 page is displayed, click 
Get Started
.
4
. 
Click 
Import a certificate
.
5
. 
For 
Certificate body
, paste the PEM-encoded certificate to import.
6
. 
For 
Certificate private key
, paste the PEM-encoded unencrypted private key that matches the certificate's public
key. 
Important:
 currently, services integrated with AWS Certificate Manager support only
the 
RSA_1024
 and 
RSA_2048
 algorithms.
7
. 
(Optional) For 
Certificate chain
, paste the PEM-encoded certificate chain.
8
. 
Click 
Next > Review and import > Import.
After preparing the certificate, ensure the status are marked as issued by AWS.
Step 3: Create an Ingress for the installation portal
Before creating an Ingress, ensure that the certificates you created in the previous steps have been issued by AWS.
Create an Ingress for port 3000 with these steps:
1
. 
Save the content below as 
installation-portal-ingress.yaml
:
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: "install-ingress"
  namespace: "core"
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: <application_loadbalancer_name>
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTPS": 3000}]'
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-protocol: HTTPS
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-port: traffic-port
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /
