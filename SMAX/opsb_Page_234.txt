Provider Tenant
In the provider tenant, you see a few additions. Firstly for each managed tenant, you will find a company record in the vendor
table.
If you then go to the full view of this record, there is an additional tab set up called “Managed Customer,” which provides view-
only details of the information added in Suite Administration.
The Mega Menu for SMAX also has an additional option in the right-hand side section labeled “MT Console."
Clicking this will take you to a view of the managed tenants and the relevant tickets available for you to work on.
