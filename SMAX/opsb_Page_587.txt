. 
On both hosts, configure IP forwarding and non-local binding.
a
. 
Append the following lines to the end of the /etc/sysctl.conf file.
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
b
. 
Load the configuration:
#sysctl -p
6
. 
On both hosts, start the Keepalived service:
#systemctl enable keepalived
#systemctl start keepalived
7
. 
Check the virtual IP by running the following commands on both HAProxy hosts.
#ip addr show dev 
eth0
The virtual IP address only appears on one of the two HAProxy hosts in the command output. 
8
. 
Change the bind address to the virtual IP for the HAProxy server.
a
. 
Change the haproxy.cfg file.
#vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
Change the "*" to the <virtual ip address> in the following lines and save it:
