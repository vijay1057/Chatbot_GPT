Set up Patroni
Perform the following steps on two hosts to set up Patroni.
Install Patroni
Run the following commands to install Patroni.
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/3.6/get-pip.py -o /tmp/get-pip.py -k
python3 /tmp/get-pip.py
pip install psycopg2-binary
pip install patroni[etcd,consul]
Prepare SSL certificates for PostgreSQL
1
. 
Create the following directory: 
mkdir -p /usr/patroni/conf 
You will copy the PostgreSQL SSL certificates to this directory. 
2
. 
Get or create a public/private key file pair, which you will use to turn on SSL for the PostgreSQL server. Here is an
example of creating a self-signed certificate.
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key server.key -out server.crt -subj "/C=UK/ST=Massachusetts/L=Cambridge/O=Microfocus/OU=ITSMA/CN
=*.domain.com"
cp server.crt /usr/patroni/conf/server.crt
cp server.key /usr/patroni/conf/server.key
3
. 
Change the certificate file mode and owner.
cd /usr/patroni/conf
chmod 400 server.crt
chmod 400 server.key
chown postgres:postgres server.key
chown postgres:postgres server.crt
Create a configuration YAML file for Patroni
1
. 
Create the following directory if you haven't created it before:
mkdir -p /usr/patroni/conf
2
. 
Run the following command to create the configuration file:
touch /usr/patroni/conf/postgresql.yml
3
. 
Run the following command to edit the newly created file:
vi /usr/patroni/conf/postgresql.yml
4
. 
Add the following configuration parameters to the file.
Make sure you change the "namespace," "listen," and "connect_address" values to reflect your own setup.
The <pg_node1/pg_node2> in the following text means <pg_node1> on pg_node1 and <pg_node2> on pg_node2.
Replace <etcd1 host address>, <etcd2 host address>, and <etcd3 host address> with your host addresses.
Replace the server.crt and server.key filenames with your own values if your PostgreSQL SSL certificate files are
different. 
scope: postgres
namespace: /pg_cluster/
name: 
<pg_node1/pg_node2>
restapi:
  listen: 
<pg_node1/pg_node2 host address>
:8008
  connect_address: 
<pg_node1/pg_node2 host address>
:8008
etcd:
  hosts: 
<etcd1 host address>
:2379, 
<etcd2 host address>
:2379, 
<etcd3 host address>
:2379
bootstrap:
  dcs:
    ttl: 30
    loop_wait: 10
    retry_timeout: 10
    maximum_lag_on_failover: 1048576
    maximum_lag_on_syncnode: 15000000
    synchronous_mode: false
    postgresql:
      use_pg_rewind: true
      use_slots: true
      parameters:
        shared_buffers: 16GB
Notes
In this example, the root CA certificate is server.crt itself. You will need to upload the root CA certificate to the
suite during the suite installation. 
The CN in the certificate must be the virtual IP address of the HAProxy cluster or the FQDN to which this IP
address resolves
