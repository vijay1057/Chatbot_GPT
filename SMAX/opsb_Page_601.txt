Disk Readahead
This topic details how to change 
Disk Readahead
 to a supported value. 
Vertica
 requires that Disk Readahead be set to at least
2048. The installer reports this issue with the identifier: 
S0020
.
RedHat/CentOS and SuSE Based Systems
For each drive in the 
Vertica
 system, 
Vertica
 recommends that you set the readahead value to at least 2048 for most
deployments. The command immediately changes the readahead value for the specified disk. The second line adds the
command to 
/etc/rc.local
 so that the setting is applied each time the system is booted. Note that some deployments may
require a higher value and the setting can be set as high as 8192, under guidance of support.
/sbin/blockdev --setra 2048 /dev/sda
echo '/sbin/blockdev --setra 2048 /dev/sda' >> /etc/rc.local
If you are using Red Hat 7.0 or CentOS 7.0 or higher, run the following command as root or sudo:
$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local
Ubuntu and Debian Systems
For each drive in the 
Vertica
 system, set the readahead value to 2048. Run the command once in your shell, then add the
command to 
/etc/rc.local
 so that the setting is applied each time the system is booted. Note that on Ubuntu systems, the last
line in rc.local must be "
exit 0
". So you must manually add the following line to 
etc/rc.local
 before the last line with 
exit 0
.
/sbin/blockdev --setra 2048 /dev/sda
Note
 
These commands must be executed with root privileges and assumes the blockdev program is in 
/sbin
.
The blockdev program operates on whole devices, and not individual partitions. You cannot set the
readahead value to different settings on the same device. If you run blockdev against a partition, for
example: /dev/sda1, then the setting is still applied to the entire /dev/sda device. For instance, running 
/sbin/bl
ockdev --setra 2048 /dev/sda1
 also causes /dev/sda2 
through
 /dev/sda
N
 to use a readahead value of 2048.

Note
For systems that do not support
 /etc/rc.local
, use the equivalent startup script that is run after the destination
runlevel has been reached. For example SuSE uses 
/etc/init.d/after.local
.
