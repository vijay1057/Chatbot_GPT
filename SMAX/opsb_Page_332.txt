Configure SSL for OPB
Before the OPB and OO can communicate, SSL certificates need to be added to the Java keystores. Without this, errors will be
reported when trying to test the connection between the Service Management Automation X Endpoint and OO.
Export OO Server Certificate
On the OO Server, go to the OO installation location. If you installed OO into the default folder paths it should be something
like:
C:\Program Files\Micro Focus\Operations Orchestration or C:\Program Files\Hewlett-Packard\HP Operations Orchestration
In <OO-Installation-Folder>\central\var\security there are two certificate stores, the key one is:
key.store
From the <OO-Installation-Folder>, go to <OO installation dir>\java\bin
Run the following command to see what alias exists in the key.store:
keytool -list -keystore “C:\Program Files\Micro Focus\Operations Orchestration\central\var\security\key.store”
To export the certificate run the following command:
keytool -export -alias tomcat -keystore "c:\Program Files\Micro Focus\Operations Orchestration\central\var\security\key.store" -file " c:\Program Files\
Micro Focus\Operations Orchestration\central\var\security \OOserver.cert"
Copy the OOserver.cert file from the 
C:\ Program Files\Micro Focus\Operations Orchestration\ central\var\security
 folder to the relevant
folder on the OPB server.
For OPB, place in the following location:
C:\ProgramData\MicroFocus\On-Premise Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\lib\security
Import SSL Certificates into OPB
This certificate file must be loaded into the OPB server for it to talk to the OO Server by SSL over port 8443. This is done by
running the following command:
keytool.exe -import -keystore "C:\ProgramData\MicroFocus\On-Premise Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\lib\security\cacerts" -alias OOServer -f
ile "C:\ProgramData\MicroFocus\On-Premise Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\lib\security\OOserver.cert"
When prompted for the password enter 'changeit'
Once the SSL certificates have been uploaded to the OPB, restart the On-Premises Bridge Agent Service.
