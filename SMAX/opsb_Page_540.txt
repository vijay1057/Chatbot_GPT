Can use either classic CMS or containerized CMS. 
Containerized CMS supports fewer installation platforms than SMAX. For information about supported platforms,
see 
Deploy Native SACM
. 
For the Native SACM support matrix, see the 
integration support matrix

Traditional OPB-based integration (deprecated and might be obsoleted in a future release)

Classic OO or OO Containerized
Think about which edition of Operations Orchestration (OO) you will need. 
If you want to use any Cloud Management capabilities, which are Design and Deploy (DND), Cost Governance and
Resource Optimization (CGRO), and Image Aggregation (IA), you must install OO Containerized.
If you don't need any Cloud Management capabilities, you can install either classic OO or OO Containerized.
