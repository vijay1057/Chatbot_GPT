We recommend that you use overlayfs for the installation. Overlayfs uses a particular file system type (either xfs with ftype=1
or ext4). Follow the steps on this page to check your file system of the OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) runtime data
directory that you defined for the 
RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME
 parameter in the install.properties file. Otherwise, skip the whole
section.
Storage drivers provide on-demand allocations for storage space, which allow you to create data in writable layers of your
containers and thus run containers on storage. The storage drivers store and manage the images and containers on your
host. OMT supports 
overlayfs
 as the preferred storage driver. By default, the OMT installation uses 
overlayfs
 as the storage
driver. It requires no extra configuration.
You must choose and set up one storage driver for all control plane nodes and worker nodes for the deployment. Because a
production environment usually has a large number of containers which requires a lot of storage space. We highly
recommend that you use 
overlayfs
 as the storage driver.
The following table provides the details of the storage driver option.

Use overlayfs as the storage driver
We highly recommend that you use 
overlayfs
 as the default storage driver for all control plane nodes and worker nodes for the
deployment. 
Overlayfs 
supports the efficient storage of image layers. The containers get started or stopped faster and
the memory usage is more efficient when you use 
overlayfs
 as the storage driver for the deployment.
Overlayfs
 requires no extra configuration and it's the recommended default Containerd storage driver for the OMT-supported
host operating systems.
To use 
overlayfs
 as the storage driver, make sure the file system of the OMT runtime data directory that you defined for the 
RU
NTIME_CDFDATA_HOME
 parameter in the install.properties is 
xfs
 with 
ftype=1
 or 
ext4
. In addition, make sure the kernel version
of the node is 3.10.0-514 or higher.
Perform the following steps to use 
overlayfs
 as the storage driver.
1
. 
Check your file system of the OMT runtime data directory to make sure that it meets the requirements of 
overlayfs
.
Currently, 
overlayfs
 only works with 
xfs
 with 
ftype=1
 or 
ext4
. You can run the following command to check the file system
of the 
RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME
 directory on the first control plane node.  For other nodes, copy
the <Installation_package_directory>/scripts/pre-check.sh script from the first control plane node to a temporary
directory.  Then run 
chmod +x pre-check.sh
 to add the execute permission:
<Installation_package_directory>/scripts/pre-check.sh --node-type <node type> --cdf-home <CDF_HOME> --runtime-home <RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME>
Replace the placeholder <Installation_package_directory> with the installation package directory. For
example:/tmp/ITOM_Platform_Foundation_Standard_202x.xx.xxxx.
Replace <CDF_HOME> with the directory that you will set for the OMT_HOME parameter in the install.properties file.
Replace <RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME> with the directory that you will set for the RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME
parameter in the install.properties file. By default, the directory defined in the RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME parameter
is <CDF_HOME>/data. For other nodes rather than the first control plane node, 
Replace <node type> with the actual node type. The supported values are: "first", "master", and "worker". "first"
refers to the first control plane node. "master" refers to the remaining control plane nodes except the first one. 
2
. 
Check the command output. If it contains the following message, the file system of the OMT runtime data directory
supports 
overlayfs
.
Checking overlayfs device is used on containerd .................... [ PASS ]
3
. 
For all nodes, the installer will use 
overlayfs
 by default as the device type. No extra step is required.
When you use 
overlayfs
 as the storage driver, the Containerd related data is stored under the directory defined in the 
RUNTIME_
CDFDATA_HOME 
parameter.
Note:
 This example contains placeholder values.
