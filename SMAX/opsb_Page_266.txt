Give the License a relevant name (in this example, 
Micro Focus
 per Processor),
 and a unique code (for this example,
mf_per_inst)
. From the Publisher drop down list, the agent may choose the company of the software they are creating the rule
for, in this example 
Adobe
. Then choose the license metric, in this case 
Micro Focus
 per Processor
. Then click 
Save
 to
complete.
Now the rule has been created it’s now possible to edit the rule by highlighting the correct row and then clicking on 
Edit
Script.
Now the agent can look at the script that is used by the rule and make modifications based upon the Vendors rules for
Software License compliance.
For information regarding creating scripts for License Rules, please see 
SAM license rules APIs
.
Also within the Edit Script function is the means of testing the rule before it’s published to determine if it will produce the
correct results based upon the data held in UCMDB.
