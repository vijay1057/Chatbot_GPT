Build EKS cluster (FIPS mode)
Role
Location
IT / Kubernetes Cluster administrator
AWS Management Console
To use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to install and manage the suite on AWS, you need to perform the following
tasks to create an EKS cluster and then launch the EKS cluster worker nodes.
Create an EKS cluster
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console and switch to the selected region.
2
. 
Go to 
All services
 > 
Management & Governance
 > 
CloudFormation.
 
3
. 
Click 
Create stack
, click 
Template is ready
 > 
Upload a template file
 > 
Choose file
 and select the 
smax-eks.template
file under directory 
../Cloud Deployment x.x.x/../byok/smax-cloudformation-aws 
in the 
cloud deployment package
.
 
4
. 
Click 
Next
 and populate the following fields:
Stack name:
 Give a name to this stack, such as 
sma-eks
.
VPC ID:
 Select the created VPC from the drop-down list.
Subnets for EKS Cluster:
 Select the three private subnets created.
EKS Cluster Name:
 Enter the EKS cluster name you defined in the 
Prepare VPC
 
step.
EKS Cluster Version:
 Select a 
supported EKS version
.
EKS Cluster Security Group:
 Select the security group created for the control plane.
5
. 
Click 
Next
 > 
Next
, acknowledge the required capabilities, and click 
Create stack
. Wait until the stack creation is
completed, and check the results on the 
Outputs
 tab.
6
. 
Check if your VPC has been properly tagged so that the EKS cluster can discover it. For details, see the AWS
document 
VPC tagging requirements
.
Launch EKS cluster worker nodes
Use the following steps to launch EKS cluster worker nodes for FIPS mode enabled installations.
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console and switch to the selected region.
2
. 
Go to 
All services
 >
EC2
. From the left navigation pane, click 
Launch Templates
 > 
Create launch template
. Name
the template and populate the following fields:
UseCustomizedImage
: Set to 
True 
to use your own customized image to build work nodes. Else leave as is.
AMI ID of the custom image for the worker nodes
: If you set 
UseCustomizedImageID
=true, input the ID
of the AMI to be used to build the node group. Else leave as is.
Snapshot ID of the AMI volume
: If you set 
UseCustomizedImageID
=true, input the ID of the volume
snapshot of the node group AMI. Else leave as is.
Amazon machine image (AMI)
: Select the AMI you created earlier. See 
Create a FIPS-enabled AMI
.
AmiType
: For normal EKS users, select AL2_x86_64 AMI type. Ignore this parameter if you are using custom AMI.
Instance type
: Select an instance type from the drop-down list. See 
Sizing considerations (EKS)
.
Key pair (login)
: Select the created EC2 key pair.
Network settings
: Select 
Virtual Private Cloud
.
Security groups
: Select the cluster's security group to allow the EKS cluster to communicate with worker. For
example, eks-cluster-sg-*.
Storage
: Enter 
100 
in the 
Size (GiB)
 field.
CapacityType
: Select 
ON_DEMAND 
for production as SPOT instance may be unstable. For R&D, we recommend
you select 
SPOT
 instance due to its cost-saving abilities.
Click 
Create launch 
template
 to launch the template.
3
. 
Go to 
All services
 > 
EKS 
> 
Clusters 
and select the EKS cluster name you defined in the 
Prepare VPC
 
step:
Note You must use the same EKS cluster name when creating the  VPC, EKS cluster, and worker nodes; otherwise, the
suite installation will fail.
1
. 
Click 
Configuration 
> 
Compute 
> 
Add node group
. Name the node group and populate the following fields:
Node IAM Role
: Enter the
 NodeInstanceRole
 value collected on the 
Outputs
 tab when the EKS cluster is
created successfully (see 
Create an EKS cluster
 ).
Enable the 
Use launch template
 button.
Note
 You must use the same EKS cluster name when creating VPC, EKS cluster, and worker nodes;
otherwise, the suite installation will fail.


Tip
  
Take a note of the
 NodeInstanceRole
 value on the 
Outputs
 tab. You will need it to launch worker
nodes in the next section.
After the EKS cluster is created, the system creates a security group for the EKS cluster (
eks-cluster-sg-
*
)
. 
You will need it when 
launching EFS
 and 
creating RDS
 later.
