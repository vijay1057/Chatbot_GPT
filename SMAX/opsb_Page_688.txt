Reverse proxy server
A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a perimeter network between an organization's internal private network and the external public
network, usually the Internet. It isolates and protects the local area network (LAN) from untrusted external traffic, adding extra
layer of security to the organization's network. 
If your organization's network includes a DMZ, any access from the Internet must go through a DMZ device that acts as a
reverse proxy. In this document, we assume that you use a reverse proxy server as the DMZ device.
The following diagram illustrates a Service Management Automation deployment in a corporate network with a DMZ. 
In this case, you need to complete the following tasks before the suite installation: 
1
. 
Determine the reverse proxy server's public DNS record name. This record should be used by the suite application
exclusively. For example: itsma.apps.yourcompany.com.
2
. 
Make sure the reverse proxy server's public DNS record is propagated.
3
. 
Determine the worker node address, which can be the FQDN or IP address.
4
. 
Set up an L4 reverse proxy on the reverse proxy server using any L4 reverse proxy solutions. Take Nginx with the stream
module enabled as an example, you need to append the following code to the end of the nginx.conf file:
stream {
          server {
              listen 443;       
              proxy_pass suite_443;       
      }        
      server {       
              listen 5443;       
              proxy_pass suite_5443;       
          }       
               
              
          upstream suite_443 {       
              server <worker node address or virtual IP address>:443;       
      }       
      upstream suite_5443 {       
              server <worker node address or virtual IP address>:5443;       
          }       
              
      }
