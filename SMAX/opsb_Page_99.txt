When you are creating a request through Service Portal, if you press Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to directly
copy and paste an existing image into the Description field and then submit the request, there
are two attachments in the API response of the request.
After you click 
Save
 to finish creating a new request through the Agent, you stay on the current
page and add a picture in the attachment. When you press F5 to refresh the page, the picture in
the Content section is missing. Instead, you see an icon suggesting that the picture can't be
loaded.

In the 
Interactions
 field of a request, if the text overflows into the next line, the word at the end
of the line is split in the middle, rather than wrapped to the next line. This issue occurs for English
and German words.
