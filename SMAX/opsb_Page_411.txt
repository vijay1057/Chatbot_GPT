Suite installation - classic
The steps to install OMT AppHub and one ITOM suite are as follows.
With embedded Kubernetes
Prepare systems for installation
Download and unpack the OMT compressed archive.
Download and unpack the metadata for the ITOM Suite
Copy the bootstrap installation files to the 1
st
 control plane node.
(optional) Configure the installation for control plane and worker nodes using the install.properties file. Alternatively
installation options can also be specified on the command line.
On the 1
st
 control plane node, start the installation of the ITOM Suite.
Point a browser to port 3000 on the 1st control plane node to continue setting up the embedded Kubernetes and the ITOM
suite.
Refer to the Suite installation/administration guide for complete package prerequisites.

Download and unpack the metadata for the ITOM Suite
Bootstrap OMT AppHub into the external Kubernetes cluster.
Connect to the suite installer using the supplied external load balancer FQDN on port 3000.

Packaging
Layers
The OMT binaries are split and located on the Micro Focus Software Depot and on Docker Hub. Micro Focus endeavors to place
a maximum number of binaries in Docker Hub. The binaries on the Micro Focus Software Depot are required for bootstrapping.
The Micro Focus Software Depot binaries come as a single compressed and digitally signed archive.
The remaining OMT binaries and the Suite binaries are located in Docker Hub. These binaries come as pre-packaged and
digitally signed container images.
All of the Suite code is hosted in Docker Hub. The container image repositories are private and require authentication (by
Docker Hub) and authorization (by Micro Focus). All of the images are digitally signed.
Docker Hub
Authentication is provided by Docker Hub. Access requires a Docker Hub account. Micro Focus doesn't create or manage
Docker Hub accounts, Micro Focus only authorizes Docker Hub accounts.
Once a Docker Hub account has been created, and with a valid agreement in place with Micro Focus for Suite access, Micro
Focus will authorize access to one or more Suite container image repositories.
A typical suite uses anywhere from 10 to 100+ container image repositories.
Helm chart
An ITOM suite or product is described by a Helm chart. The Helm chart describes the composition of a suite and a set of
runtime requirements such as volumes for persistent storage and also includes the deployment configuration for Kubernetes.
By using th Helm CLI or the Micro Focus Apphub Helm chart installer, customers can deploy the ITOM suite or product.
