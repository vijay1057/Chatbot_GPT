Now the flow can be fully joined up. The key here is to understand what you expect to happen as this flow runs through. The
flow starts at the SQL command. If the command can be actioned correctly then a success outcome is returned. If the SQL
Command fails, then an incident needs to be created within SMAX. For OO to create an incident in SMAX, first it must log in
and acquire SSO Token as the user is then authorized to log in. Then using the account details provided via the SMAX
integration user, it will then create an incident in SMAX based upon the fact that the SQL Command failed.
The flow will now look like this:
Now the flow has been designed, the next part required is all the inputs to allow the flow to work.
At the bottom of the screen click on Properties
Here all the required inputs that need to be supplied from SMAX need to be entered.
