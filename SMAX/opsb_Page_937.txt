Verify creating Amazon RDS
After creating the Amazon RDS instance, you must test its connectivity by running the command below on the bastion node. 
psql -h <RDSEndpointAddress> -p <RDSEndpointPort> -U <postgres_admin> -d postgres
Where: 
<RDSEndpointAddress>, <RDSEndpointPort>
: get these values in the 
Outputs 
of the previous step. 
<postgres_admin>
 is the PostgreSQL admin user you specified when launching the Amazon RDS instance. Replace it with
the actual value.
