previously.
The asset tag must be unique for each software license, and it’s also important to create a consistent naming
convention. Try to include the product vendor and some details about the product.
Specify the number of licenses purchased for the product and details about the unit rights. Once you set 
Quantity
and 
Unit rights
, the 
Total rights
 field will be automatically populated.
Only licenses in the Pool, Prepare, and Receive phases allow license consumption. In all other phases, the license
consumption calculation won’t be taken into account.
If you are also using the 
original SAM application
 in SMAX, you will see a License metric field in the dialog box. We
recommend that you remove this legacy field from all the forms that contain this field for the License and Asset
Model record types in 
Administration 
> 
Configuration 
> 
Studio
. For more information, see
