Prepare persistent volumes for Audit service
Audit service installation in Helm mode requires the following Persistent Volumes (PVs). PVs are relevant to Elastic File System
(EFS) volumes.
Component
Persistent volume name
Description
ITOM Audit
as-vault-volume-<Audit Namespace>
PV for configuration
ITOM Audit
as-log-volume-<Audit Namespace>
PV for logs
If you want to create the required PVs from scratch, perform the following tasks:
1
. 
Navigate to the audit install directory (
audit-<version>) 
that you created when downloading the audit Helm chart. For
example:
cd <audit_install-dir>/audit-2022.11
2
. 
To find or verify the FQDN of the EFS server and the EFS directory path, run the following two commands.
3
. 
To find the name of the global volume, run the following command:
kubectl get pv | grep 'global'
4
. 
To describe the PV, run this command:
kubectl describe pv <pv name of global volume that you found from the previous step>
Part of the output:
...
Source:
    Type:      NFS (an NFS mount that lasts the lifetime of a pod)
    Server:   aws-efs.example.net
    Path:      /var/vols/itom/itsma/global-volume
    ReadOnly:  false
where,
Server
: Gives you the FQDN of the EFS server
Path
: The path information you will need to give in the 
itom-audit
-pv.yaml 
file should start with the same path
till the 
itom
 directory as shown by the 
Path
 attribute of the global volume, for example, 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/global-
volume
.
5
. 
Open the 
itom-audit
-pv.yaml 
file with a text editor, give the FQDN of the EFS server and the EFS directory path that
you provided during the creation of the EFS volumes, and then save the file.
6
. 
Run the following command to create persistent volumes:
kubectl create -f itom-audit-pv.yaml
Output:
persistentvolume/as-vault-volume-auditns created
persistentvolume/as-log-volume-auditns created
7
. 
Run the following command to verify the volume creation:
kubectl get pv |grep audit
Output:
as-log-volume-auditns      5Gi     RWX      Retain     Available           itom-audit-sc     17s
as-vault-volume-auditns    5Gi     RWX      Retain     Available           itom-audit-sc     17s
