. 
Change the permission for each directory that you created.
If you are using the same base directory for all NFS volumes, you can simply run the 
chmod -R 755 <base
directory> 
command. For example:
chmod -R 755 /var/vols/itom
If you aren't using the same base directory, repeat the 
chmod 
command for each NFS directory. For example:
chmod -R 755 /var/vols/itom/core
...
chmod -R 755 /var/vols/itom/itsma-smarta-sawmeta-con-a-1
7
. 
Add a group and user:
groupadd -g <SYSTEM_GROUP_ID> itsma
useradd -g <SYSTEM_GROUP_ID> -u <SYSTEM_USER_ID> itsma
For example: 
groupadd -g 1999 itsma
useradd -g 1999 -u 1999 itsma
8
. 
Change the owner of each directory that you created by using the 
chown -R <SYSTEM_USER_ID>:
<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID> <NFS volume export path>
 command.  
If you're using the same base directory for all NFS volumes, simply run the 
chown -R <SYSTEM_USER_ID>:
<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID> <base directory>
 command. For example:
chown -R 1999:1999 /var/vols/itom
