Integration with Operations Orchestration
Introduction
Service Management Automation X provides an Operations Orchestration (OO) integration that allows you to automate tasks or
integrate with other products. The integration uses the On-Premises Bridge to connect SMAX to an Operations Orchestration
installation. This document describes how to configure the OO integration with Service Management Automation X and
provides an example of how to use SMAX with OO.
This chapter will include instructions to:
Create the OPB Integration User
Install the OPB Agent
Configure SSL for OPB

A suite admin user needs to create an Integration User within the Suite Administration before it can be used within the Tenant.
To do this, access the Suite Administration URL. The URL resembles the following example:
https://smademovm07.swinfra.net/BO
  
Once logged in go to the Users section.
Click New to add an Integration user.
Enter all relevant user details, paying key attention to the Role value, where the account must be set to
