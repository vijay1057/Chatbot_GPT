Notes:
* This is the minimum resources requirements for SMA deployment. According to sizing definition benchmark results, our lab
tests indicate the average CPU utilization is 40 ~ 60%, and the memory utilization is 60 ~ 75%. If one node is down, it may
cause services to be unavailable. From node high availability consideration, it's recommended that you add at least one
additional node or more depending on your actual environments such as ticket size, user access rate, and integrations.
** The volume sizes may grow on a daily basis. Check

If you use Azure Files as storage, Azure Disks are used to store the Smart Analytics and RabbitMQ data, which will provision
disk dynamically and consume 1 TB of disk usage at most.
*** Check the

 below for the details to prepare Azure NetApp Files for SMA. The
volume quota is used to reserve better performance on storage.

Additional hardware requirements for OO
The following sizing requirements denote the target deployment size for a dedicated OO database, based on the number of
tenants. This is not based on concurrent users.
To deploy OO for a 5-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here
.
To deploy OO for a 20-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
