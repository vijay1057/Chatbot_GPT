Generate sensitive data for OO
The outcome of this step is the creation of a Kubernetes secret named 
oo-secret
, which holds the required sensitive data that
OO needs at install time.
The name of this Kubernetes secret is by default referenced in the OO 
values.yaml
 (at Helm parameter 
global.initSecrets
). At
OO install time, its data is automatically consumed by the deployed OO pods.  
Use the 
gen_secrets.sh
 script from OMT to prepare the sensitive data.

. 
Run the following command on the bastion node:
OMT_External_K8s_2022.xx.xxxxx/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n <
OO NAMESPACE
> -c <
OO CHART FILE
>
Where:
<OO NAMESPACE>
 = the unique namespace of the OO deployment. Use the namespace that you specified in the
Create a new deployment for OO on EKS
 topic.
<OO CHART FILE>
 = the absolute path of the OO chart file
For example:
OMT_External_K8s_2022.xx.xxxxx/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n oo -c oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx/oo-helm-charts/charts/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx.tgz
