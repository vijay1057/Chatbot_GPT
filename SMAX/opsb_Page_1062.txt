Note
: When creating your my-values.yaml file, keep the following in mind:
You need to set the 
global.externalAccessPort
 parameter to the port for CMS.
You need to set the 
global.externalAccessHost
 parameter to the FQDN for CMS.
As CMS is installed as the next deployment of SMAX, you need to use the shared IdM (SMAX IdM) to manage
CMS users. To do this, make sure that the 
global.idm.internal
 parameter to 
false. 
 Additionally, you also
need to configure the parameters as described in the 
SMAX integration parameters
 section.
