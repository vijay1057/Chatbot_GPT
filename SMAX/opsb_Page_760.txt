Install OO Containerized on-premises
Perform the following tasks to deploy Operations Orchestration Containerized.
On the control plane node, run the following command:
helm install <
OO INSTALL NAME>
 <
OO CHART FILE>
 --namespace <
OO NAMESPACE>
 -f <
values.yaml>
 -f <
oo_size_values.yaml> --set-file "caCertificates.cert_one\.crt"=/path/to/cert_one.crt
Where:
<
OO INSTALL NAME
> =
 the unique release name that you need to specify for the OO deployment. You need to use the
same release name as specified here when you upgrade OO in the future.
<
OO CHART FILE
> = 
the absolute path of the OO chart file
<
OO NAMESPACE
> = 
unique namespace of the OO deployment. Use the namespace that you specified in the 
Create a new
deployment for OO
 topic.
<values.yaml
 > = the path to OO 
v
alues.yaml 
file configured as part of preparation step 
Create and configure
values.yaml file
.
<oo_size_values.yaml>
 = the path to OO sizing configuration file. It can be any of these: 
The file created as part of preparation step 
Create and configure oo_size_values.yaml file
. 
The 
/samples/oo_sizing/oo_default_sizing.yaml
 sizing file that's available for a five tenants sizing. Use this file to deploy OO with
a default sizing required for five tenants. 
The 
/samples/oo_sizing/oo_20tenants_sizing.yaml
 that's available for a 20 tenants sizing.
<--set-file>
 = These are optional arguments because they address one way of having OO trust specific
certificates. Depending on your choice during the preparation of OO 
values.yaml 
(see 
SMAX integration parameters
):
If you opted for providing the required certificates at OO install time, then you are required to do so using the 
--set-
file
 parameter.
If you provided the certificates directly in the OO 
values.yaml
, then don't use the 
--set-file
 parameter with the Helm
install command.
For example:
helm install oo oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx/oo-helm-charts/charts/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx.tgz --namespace oo -f values.yaml -f oo_size_values.yaml --set-file "caCertificates.cert_one\.crt"=/path/to/cert_one.crt
You can run the command mentioned earlier with the 
--dry-run
 argument to simulate an installation. It's useful to validate the
content in the 
values.yaml
 file before a real installation.
