Can I change the instance type of a worker node after AKS cluster creation?
Yes, you can. You can edit your VM's size individually. However, Azure doesn't recommend changing the instance type on the
worker node directly. The recommended procedure and best practice is to add a second agentpool to the cluster and choose
the new VM Size you want for that new agentpool. Then you can delete the old one. For details,
see 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools
.
Can I use Kubenet network plugins other than Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) when setting up an AKS
cluster? Why?
Yes.  Both Kubenet and Azure CNI are certified for SMA with AKS. See the 
best practices
 recommended by Azure to choose the
plugins based on your needs. 
For Azure File, can I use standard Azure File Service Level?
No. You can only use the premium size, because only Premium meets the performance requirements. So Premium is
the minimum required Azure File Service Level in our sizing requirements. Using the standard level will cause performance
issues.
