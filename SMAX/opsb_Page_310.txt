It is also important to note the logical type of the field in question. There are certain types of fields that need special
consideration. These types (and how to use them correctly in the API) are defined below.
Enumerations
If the field in question has a Logical type of ‘ENUM’, which is an enumeration, you must pass the internal name of the
enumeration value rather than the display name. To find the name, open the list in the List management interface, which will
display both the internal name and display name of each list value. For example, in the list shown in the image below, the
status value for ‘Ready’ would be ‘RequestStatusReady’.
The body of a REST request that would update the request with a status of ‘Ready’ is shown in the following image: 
Entity links
If the field type is an entity_link (a link to a related entity/record) type field you must specify the unique id of the related record
in the REST API (rather than any display name or value). Therefore you must determine what the id is and incorporating that
value into the REST call. In the example below, the user wants to set the assignment group in a request to ‘Accounting’. To do
this the user will first find the id of the accounting group and then set the ‘AssignedToGroup’ field in the request to the Id of
the accounting group in the rest payload. The id may be found by viewing the related record directly or viewing a list that
includes the related record.
Then the id is entered for the ‘AssignedToGroup’ attribute in the body of the REST request.
