Infrastructure (embedded K8S), OMT AppHub and suites are split into different certificate zones or realms:
Realm
acronym
Name
For components
RIC
Realm Internal Cluster
CA and certs for K8S and AppHub namespace components
RID
Realm Internal
Deployment
CA and certs for components running in the suite namespace
RE
Realm External
Cert loaded on NGINX controllers
CUS
Custom realm
Any Pod can request creation of custom CA and certs from that for special
purposes.
Certificate and Vault token generation
The below diagram shows:
Creation of self-generated root CA (uses openssl). The validity period is 10 years.
Creation of cluster communication certificates for base Kubernetes components (uses openssl). The validity period is 1
year.
Import of root CAs into the Vault pki backend
Generation of Vault access tokens for secure configuration data access for remaining OMT AppHub and Suite containers
(uses Vault). The validity is 30 minutes for an access token; inside the Pod the certificate is renewed automatically to
prevent expiry. See also sidecar container and Kubernetes-vault chapters.
Generation of server certificates for server processes inside remaining for OMT AppHub and Suite containers (uses Vault).
The validity period is 1 year.
