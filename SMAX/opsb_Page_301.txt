On systems that have a large amount of data, BI sync will create files in the format Request_0.csv, Request_1.csv,
Request_2.csv etc. Power BI is able to combine the data into a single table using a few extra steps. Power BI is able to combine
files located in the same directory. Create a directory named “Request” (for this example) and put the files into this folder.
In this example, there are 3 Request files that need to be combined.
Click on the ‘get data’ button, then click ‘connect’. Select the folder that has the Request files in it and click ok.
Select the folder that contains the files and click ok.
Click the ‘combine’ button and select the ‘combine and load’ option.
Click on the ok button, and the files will be loaded.
When the files load, the Requests panel on the side will contain information from all of the files. The links between the entities
are handled the same way as they are with a single file.
