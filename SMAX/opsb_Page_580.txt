/CentOS 8. 
2 VMs for Patroni and PostgreSQL
These two VMS need to meet hardware requirements described in 
Plan the deployment
.
2 VMs for HAProxy. Each VM must have a configuration of 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM.
In the following procedure, 
pg_node1 
and 
pg_node2 
refer to the two VMs for PostgreSQL, and 
etcd1
, 
etcd2, 
and 
etcd3
refer to the Etcd hosts. 
Prepare super user permission
You must have super user permission on these VMs. Run the installation commands as root.
Prepare a virtual IP address for HAproxy
Prepare an IP address as the virtual IP address of the HAproxy hosts.
Allow specific inbound ports for the VMs
Run the following commands for different VMs to allow the specific inbound ports.
1
. 
On the two Patroni & Postgresql hosts, run the following commands:
firewall-cmd --add-port={5432,8008}/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
2
. 
On  the two HAProxy hosts, run the following commands:
firewall-cmd --add-port={5000,6000,7000}/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
3
. 
On the three Etcd cluster hosts, run the following commands:
firewall-cmd --add-port={2379,2380}/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
Install Etcd
Install Etcd on each of the three hosts.
1
. 
Download the Etcd rpm file, and then run the following command to install Etcd:
rpm -ihv etcd-3.2.21-2.el8.x86_64.rpm
2
. 
Modify the 
/etc/etcd/etcd.conf
 file. Locate and uncomment the following parameters, and make sure you update the
highlighted values to reflect yours.
For the file on etcd1
: 
[Member]
ETCD_LISTEN_PEER_URLS="http://
<etcd1 host address>
:2380"
ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS="http://
<etcd1 host address>
:2379,http://localhost:2379"
ETCD_NAME="
etcd1
"
[Clustering]
ETCD_INITIAL_ADVERTISE_PEER_URLS="http://
<etcd1 host address>
:2380"
ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLIENT_URLS="http://
<etcd1 host address>
:2379"
Note
Etcd requires three VMs. You don't need to use dedicated VMs for Etcd; instead, use shared VMs for Etcd: the two
VMs for PostgreSQL, and one VM for HAProxy.
All of the VMs must have the same operating system and version. For example, if the two hosts for HAProxy are
running on RHEL 8 and CentOS 8 respectively, the HA setup will fail.

Note
 You can change the ports if you use different ports on the Etcd service, Postgresql service, Patroni
service, and HAProxy service (if used). The default ports for these services are as follows:
Service Etcd Ports: 2379, 2380
Service Postgresql Port: 5432
Service Patroni Port: 8008
Service HAProxy Port: 5000, 6000, 7000
The following example uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.2, Patroni 2.1.3, PG12, Etcd 3.3.11, Keepalived
2.1.5-6, and HAProxy1.8.27/F5 load balancer as example versions. 
The parameters in the example are set for 2000 concurrent users for SMAX. Be sure to change the parameters
according to your environment.
