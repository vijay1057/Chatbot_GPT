Service Management Automation X also provides an option to view all the changes defined in the release using the calendar.
From the calendar, the release manager can review and change the planned start and end time of each change — as long as
they are contained within the start and end times of the release.
Setting up Release Management
Again, setting up release management is very similar to setting up the other modules we have addressed so far. Release uses
the same record categories we have seen before, so we need to review those and create any additional ones that we might
need. We can also review the existing views and reports and add any we might find necessary.
As we should expect by now, there are a few things we need to do that are specific to release management. This includes
setting up any necessary release models we might need to best support our current release process.
Creating Release Models
Many of our releases are on a set schedule; every quarter, every month, etc. Release models allow us to create the framework
for these releases so we don’t have to re-enter the same information every time. This also includes defining specific tasks that
we need to complete during the release life-cycle. Remember, these tasks don't relate to the actual changes that make up the
release, but on the overall process of the release itself.
