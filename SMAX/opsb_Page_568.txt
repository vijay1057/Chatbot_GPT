Deploy the suite on-premises
This section provides information required to install and configure the 
Service Management Automation (SMA) suite 
in
an on-premises environment, including the preparation, installation, and setup tasks.
Before you begin, ensure that you have the deployment architecture planned and have the servers allocated as the control
plane and worker nodes.
The following table provides a list of tasks that you must complete in the given order. A user can have multiple roles.
