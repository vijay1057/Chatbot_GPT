Persistent container storage is hosted using NFS or Ceph.
NFS
A typical Linux OS - hosted single NFS server doesn't offer much in terms of HA.
To increase the level of HA for the NFS storage, various options exist:
The NFS server data partitions use software or hardware RAID
The NFS server data partitions is hosted on network-attached storage. Example:
StoreEasy Storage
The NFS server itself is virtualized and provided by the storage array software/hardware. Examples:
3PAR File Persona Software
NetApp
Other storage vendors may offer similar capabilities. Refer to the vendor documentation for details.
Setup an active/passive NFS server in an HA cluster. This approach is available and documented from various Linux
vendors/distributions. Links:

Component replicated database
The ETCD component will use a replicated database in MMMW cluster configuration. The database will be replicated across all
control plane nodes.
Component external databases
Application components can be configured to use an external database. See also section “High availability through use of
external databases”.
Multi-control plane and HA virtual IP
Leader election for ETCD
When installing OMT embedded Kubernetes with multiple control plane nodes, the supported number is 3 control plane nodes.
This is so that the leader election for ETCD’s distributed database scheme works properly.
HA virtual IP
All of the control plane nodes participate in the HA virtual IP configuration. This is so that a pre-defined IP address configurable
through the OMT embedded Kubernetes installer configuration file (install.properties) can be bound to all of the control plane
nodes depending on which one is found to be alive or load-balance across all control plane nodes if they're both found to be
active.
For this to work, the installer sets up and runs a copy of keepalived on each control plane node make the Kubernetes API
server highly available.
High availability through use of external databases
Connecting the applications such as OMT AppHub and suites to (an) external database(s) contributes positively to the level of
HA.
Highly available storage
This can be provided through a highly available NFS server or Ceph cluster setup coupled with a highly available storage array
or storage.
 
Note
This document doesn't cover setting up external database HA.
