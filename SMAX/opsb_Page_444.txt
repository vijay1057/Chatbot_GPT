Licensing
Single License File
OMT delivers a Licensing service that allows the Suite to simply deploy a single license file for their Suite, injecting dynamically
all the software license keys in each individual product. This simplifies the license management process when deploying the
ITOM suite as software bundle.
Redeem License
Based on the customer entitlements, customer can visit the Micro Focus software entitlement site to redeem and download the
exact Suite level license. Similar to other software licenses, we offer both production and non-production licenses allowing a
greater flexibility for evaluation and staging environments.
When connecting to the License Management Server console, customers can load their downloaded license file and proceed.
License Management
The License Management Server console allows customers to add/remove/redeem licenses once the suite has been deployed.
Customer can manage additional entitlements based on additional purchases.
