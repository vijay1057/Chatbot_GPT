This successfully shows the OO flow created an incident due to the fact the details entered into the Service Request weren’t
correct, so it was unable to connect to the DB. So, an incident has been raised by the cmdbopb user.
Again if the additional steps were undertaken what you’ll see is that the Incident is now linked to the request.
The SmaxIncidentID contains the created incident number and the OO Completion Result also gives some error information.
If you click on Related Records, you’ll see the Incident that is linked to the Request.
Troubleshooting
When troubleshooting the Integration between Service Management Automation X and OO there are several places to look.
The first place is within Service Management Automation X portal specifically looking at the Integration to check that no errors
are being reported either with the Agent or on the actual OO Endpoint. If there are errors being shown here, it’s possible there
is a problem with the OPB. In which case log on to the OPB Server and check the following log locations:
<OPB Install location>\On-Premise Bridge Agent\product\log\OperationOrchestrationDomain-1.0
In here check the following logs which should help to show if there is a communication problem from the OPB to OO:
OperationOrchestrationDomain-1.0.log.0
error.log
output.log
If the integration was successful but there are problems when trying to run an OO flow through SMAX the following log files
which are stored in /var/vols/itom/itsma/global-volume/logs/xservices/platform/ look for the latest platform pod and then go to
the maas folder. Inside you should look for the following logs:
Maas_error.log
Maas_workflow.log
Maas_oo_integration.log
Maas_unhandled_exceptions.log
Sometimes when using OO there may be a problem showing output from an OO flow within a User Option created in SMAX. If
this problem occurs follow this procedure:
The rule of Property AITOOResultMessage is disabled is created by below request rule
"Disable all fields on the request tracking page in the Self-Service portal"
Follow below steps to add allow rule.
1
. 
Click Rendering form and click “Add a rule to run before request record rules”
2
. 
Choose Restrict/allow editing of fields in pop window and click ok button.
3
. 
Choose “Allow” in field “Restrict/allow”
4
. 
Click “all fields/ specific fields(optional)” and click Specific fields
5
. 
Click Add item and choose <Field Name>
6
. 
Select <Field Name> from dropdown and click ok and save button
If the integration still doesn’t work, contact the Service Management Automation X Support team and create a ticket. Be sure
that all the OPB logs and configuration files are included.
