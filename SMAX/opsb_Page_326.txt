Creating the REST body using JAVA
The same concepts used with Postman may be used to create requests using a script or application. The same multi-part/form
data approach may be used. The file content must be extracted and placed into the body fo the request. The below code
shows one example of how the body may be constructed from a Java File object. The File object is referenced as “fi” in the
code example. Note that the Content-Type must also be specified, and the code below only supports files of type .jpg, .pdf, or
.txt, but could be extended to support other types.
Important note:
 
the following code is presented as an example of one way to create the request body. It should not be
interpreted as the best or only way to perform this function and is not officially supported in any way by

// Attachment file
File fi = new File(…);
// Get file extension
String extension = "";
 int i = fi.toString().lastIndexOf('.'); 
if (i > 0) { 
    extension = fi.toString().substring(i+1);
 } 
String contentType = "text/plain"; 
if ( extension.equals("jpg"))
     contentType = "image/jpeg";
 if ( extension.equals("pdf")) 
    contentType = "application/pdf";
 if ( extension.equals("png"))
     contentType = "image/png";
// Generate prefix and suffix 
String prefix = "--YYYY\n" + 
        "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"files[]\"; filename=\""+ fi.getName()
         +"\"\n" + 
        "Content-Type: "+ contentType + "\n" +
         "\n";  String suffix = "\n" + "--YYYY--\n";
// Calculate total payload length 
long payloadLength = prefix.length() + fi.length() + suffix.length();
// Setup connection
HttpsURLConnection con = …
con.setRequestMethod("POST");
// Other headers
…
// Set HTTP connection output stream for POST body as non-cached fixed length
// The full content of the body is not stored in memory 
con.setDoOutput(true);
 con.setFixedLengthStreamingMode(payloadLength);
 OutputStream os = con.getOutputStream(); 
DataOutputStream ds = new DataOutputStream(os);
// Write prefix to stream (as ASCII) 
ds.writeBytes(prefix);  
// Write file content to stream (as binary 8-bit octets)
 InputStream is = new FileInputStream(fi); 
byte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; 
int bytesRead; 
while ((bytesRead = is.read(buffer)) != -1 ) {
     ds.write(buffer, 0 , bytesRead); 
}  
// Write suffix to stream (as ASCII) ds.writeBytes(suffix);  ds.close();
// Handle HTTP response …
