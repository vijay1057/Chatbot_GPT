Prepare persistent volumes for OO
Operations Orchestration (OO) Containerized installation requires below Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume
Claims (PVC). PVs are pieces of storage relevant to NFS volumes, and PVCs are requests for a piece of storage on a volume. 
Currently, the way OO Containerized uses persistent storage is by providing the names of the required PVCs at OO install time
via Helm parameters, which means that both PVs and PVCs must be created upfront.

Create Persistent Volumes
1
. 
Navigate to the OO chart package directory. For example:
oo-1.0.x+2022xx01-xx/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx/oo-helm-charts/samples/persistent_storage/on_premises/
2
. 
Open the 
volumes.yaml
 
file with a text editor, add the below information in each volume template then save the file:
The FQDN of the NFS server.
The NFS directory path that you provided during the creation of the NFS volumes.
The Storage Class Name that needs to be used with the OO volumes.
3
. 
Run the following command to create persistent volumes:
  kubectl create -f oo-1.0.x+2022xx01-xx/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx/oo-helm-charts/samples/persistent_storage/on_premises/volumes.yaml
4
. 
Run the following command to verify the volume creation:
  kubectl get pv | grep oo
Create Persistent Volume Claims
1
. 
Navigate to the OO chart package directory. For example:
  cd oo-1.0.x+2022xx01-xx/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx/oo-helm-charts/samples/persistent_storage/on_premises/
2
. 
Open the 
claims.yaml
 
file with a text editor, provide the below information in each volume claim template, and then
save the file:
The namespace where OO will be deployed. You provided the namespace as part of the preparation step in 
Create a
new deployment for OO
.
The name of the volume that the PVC is bound to.
If you have used a Storage Class Name during the creation of the OO volumes, then provide the name(s) of the
Storage Class for each PVC to bound to the corresponding volume.
Note
:
By default, the 
storageClassName
 attribute of the PVs is empty.
If you have one or more storageClasses that you want the OO volumes to use, then add the Storage
Class Names for each volume.
You can use a different Storage Class name for each individual volume, or the same Storage Class
Name for all volumes.

Note:
The relationship between the OO volume claims and OO volumes is the following:
oo-config-pvc -> oo-config-vol
oo-data-pvc -> oo-data-vol
oo-logs-pvc -> oo-logs-vol
oo-data-export-pvc -> oo-data-export-vol
oo-ras-logs-pvc -> oo-ras-logs-vol
