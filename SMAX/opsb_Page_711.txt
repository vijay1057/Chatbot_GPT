Prepare persistent volumes for CMS
CMS installation in Helm mode requires below Persistent Volumes (PVs). PVs are relevant to NFS volumes. In the production
environment, you must use the external databases for the CMS application, then PV for 
cms-db-volume
 is not needed. 
Component
Persistent volume name
Description
CMS
cms-config-volume
PV for configuration
CMS
cms-data-volume
PV for data
CMS
cms-log-volume
PV for logs
CMS
cms-db-volume(optional)
PV for internal database, only for demo use
If you already have the PVs available for use, you need to ensure that the storageClassName attribute of the PVs is the same
as the storage class name in the 
values.yaml
 file. In the later step, you will need to specify the name of PV to be bound with
one of the persistent volume claims (PVCs).
If you want to create the required PVs from scratch, perform the following tasks:
1
. 
Navigate to the CMS chart package directory. For example:
cd CMS_Helm_Chart-2022.11/cms-helm-charts/samples/
2
. 
Open the 
cms-pv.yaml 
file with a text editor, provide the FQDN of the NFS server and the NFS directory path that you
provided during the creation of the NFS volumes, and then save the file.
3
. 
Run the following command to create persistent volumes:
kubectl create -f CMS_Helm_Chart-2022.11/cms-helm-charts/samples/cms-pv.yaml
4
. 
Run the following command to verify the volume creation:
kubectl get pv |grep cms
Note 
By default, the storageClassName attribute of the PVs is empty. If you change the value, make sure
that the storageClassName attribute of the PVs is the same as the storage class name in the 
values.yaml
file so that the PVs and PVCs can be bound together.
