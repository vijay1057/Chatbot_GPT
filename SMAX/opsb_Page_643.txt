Open the required ports 
OMT and the suite can be installed in a firewalled environment. Certain ports are needed by OMT and the suite during or after
the installation. You need to make sure these ports are open in your firewall settings and aren't in use on the host VMs. For
details, see 
Enable a firewall in the suite environment

Enable vrrp protocol for Keepalived in a multiple-control plane node deployment when
a firewall is enabled
If you want to set up a multiple-control plane node HA environment through setting the 
HA_VIRTUAL_IP 
parameter
 
in the 
install.pr
operties 
file, make sure the 
vrrp
 protocol is enabled when you have enabled the firewall on the node. The 
vrrp
 protocol is used
by Keepalived to support virtual IP. In most default settings, the 
vrrp
 protocol is enabled. If you have used some custom
settings for the server or if Keepalived doesn't work well, run the following command on the node to enable the 
vrrp
 protocol:
firewall-cmd --add-protocol vrrp  --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
Note
During installation, the OMT installer performs a precheck of the OMT required ports on the control plane
node and worker node hosts. A port passes the precheck as long as it's not in use on the host, regardless of
whether it's open or not in your firewall. For this reason, if your suite environment is firewalled, you always need
to check that the required ports are open in the firewall.
