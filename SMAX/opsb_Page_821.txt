Create stack
. Wait until the stack creation finishes and you can check the results on the 
Outputs
tab. The template creates three security groups automatically for the control plane node, worker nodes, and the bastion
node. You will need these security groups later when 
creating the EKS cluster
, 
launching working nodes
, and 
creating the
bastion node
/
EFS
/
RDS
 respectively.
Option 2: Deploy in the existing VPC
If you need to deploy the suite in an existing VPC and your IT policy allows private subnets and public subnets to be deployed
in the same VPC, follow these steps:
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console and switch to the selected region.
2
. 
Tag your VPC so that the EKS cluster can discover it. For details, see the AWS document 
VPC tagging requirements
.

 >

Select the existing VPC and make sure 
DNS resolution
 and 
DNS hostnames
 are enabled.

. 
Click 
Next
 and populate the following fields.
Stack name:
 Give a name to this stack, such as 
sma-network-without-vpc
.
VPC ID:
 Select your target VPC from the drop-down list.
VPC CIDR:
 Enter the CIDR of the target VPC.
EKS Cluster Name:
 Give a name to your EKS cluster.
Availability Zone
: Select three availability zones from the drop-down list and each availability zone must be
different, 
such as us-gov-west-1a, us-gov-west-1b, us-gov-west-1c
.
Public Subnet 1/2/3 CIDR:
 Define a CIDR block for each public subnet. Public subnets will be used to deploy bastion
instance, load balancer, and NAT Gateway.
Private Subnet 1/2/3 CIDR:
 Define a CIDR block for each private subnet. Private subnets will be used to deploy the
EKS cluster, worker nodes, and EFS.
Database Subnet 1/2 CIDR:
 Define a CIDR block for each database subnet. Database subnets will be used to
deploy RDS.

Option 3: Deploy in existing VPC and subnets
If you need to deploy the suite in an existing VPC and subnets and your IT policy doesn't allow private subnets and public
subnets to be deployed in the same VPC, follow these steps to check if your VPC and subnets meet the network requirements.
If not, you need to manually update the network settings as required. 
Note:
 As the application is mainly deployed inside the private VPC, this deployment is also called 
private network
deployment.
Step 1. Check the requirements for the VPC and subnets
1
. 
The private VPC should have a CIDR of at least /21. Make sure DNS resolution and DNS hostnames are enabled. To do
this:
a
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console and switch to the selected region.
b
. 
Go to 
All services
 > 
Networking & Content Delivery
 > 
VPC.
Actions
 > 
Edit DNS resolution
, tick the 
Enable
 option, and click 
Save changes.
Actions
 > 
Edit DNS hostnames
, tick the 
Enable
 option, and click 
Save changes.

Subnets
Three subnets should sit in at least two Availability Zones, better to sit in three Availability Zones, with a CIDR of at
least /24, configured as private subnets. (No direct internet access).
Two subnets sit in two Availability Zones, for the database.

 You will need this EKS cluster name when you build the EKS cluster and launch worker nodes
later.
