Hardware requirements for other options
If none of the typical deployment options described previously meets your needs, use the following guidelines.
How to calculate hardware resources
You can determine your hardware requirements as follows:
1
. 
Use the deployment size definitions for the SMA capability to determine the SMA deployment size and required hardware
resources (see 
Hardware requirements for option 1
). Use this hardware resource requirement as a basis. 
2
. 
Use the deployment size definitions for each of the other desired capabilities to determine their deployment size and
additional hardware resources required. 
3
. 
Calculate the total hardware resources required by adding up the requirements for all capabilities, and add resources as
needed: worker nodes, CPU, RAM, and disk storage. Note that when calculating how many worker nodes are needed, keep
in mind that all worker nodes must have the same hardware specification provided here because Kubernetes schedules
pods across all of the worker nodes. 
Additional hardware resources for add-on capabilities and CMS
Use the following information to calculate the additional hardware resources for each add-on capability. 
Additional hardware requirements for SAM

Additional hardware requirements for OO Containerized
The following sizing requirements denote the target deployment size for a dedicated OO database, based on the number of
tenants. This is not based on concurrent users.
To deploy OO for a 5-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here
.
To deploy OO for a 20-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here
