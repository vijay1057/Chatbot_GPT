Configure NFS volumes
If a container stops and is then restarted, all changes made inside the container get lost. To save information such as
configuration files or databases, the system must store the information in a persistent volume provided by a Network File
System (NFS). To install OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) and then deploy the suite on OMT, you need to export NFS volumes
to store OMT and suite data. 
NFS volumes required for OMT and the suite
In the following table, the 
NFS volume label
 column lists the OMT core volume (itom-vol-claim) which you will need
to specify when running the 
install
 script to install OMT, and the NFS volumes that you will see in the installation portal UI when
configuring File Storage. 
In the installation portal UI, you can either manually configure NFS volumes or use the
 Auto-fill
 feature to let the installer
automatically configure them for you. Be aware that 
Auto-fill
 requires each NFS volume to reside in the same parent NFS
folder (on the same NFS server) and use the exact volume display label in the installation portal UI as the subfolder name. The
parent NFS folder is referred to below as <base directory>. For example, if <base directory> is 
/var/vols/itom
 and the volume
display label  is 
global-volume
, then the NFS export path must be 
/var/vols/itom/global-volume
 to use 
Auto-fill
.
