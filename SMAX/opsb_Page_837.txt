Configure EFS
This section describes how to create AWS EFS to store OMT and SMA data on AWS, as well as how to configure EFS volumes.

Click 
Next
 and populate the following fields:
Stack name:
 Give a name to this stack, such as 
sma-efs
.
VPC ID:
 Select your created VPC from the drop-down list.
Subnets for EFS:
 Select the three private subnets created.
EFS Performance Mode
: Select the default value, 
generalPurpose
.
EFS Name
: Give a name to this EFS instance, such as 
smax-efs
.
BastionSecurityGroup
: Select the bastion's security group to allow the bastion node to communicate with EFS.
ClusterSecurityGroup
: Select the EKS cluster's security group (
eks-cluster-sg-*
) to allow the EKS cluster to
communicate with EFS.

Bastion node
1
. 
Log in to the bastion with the following command: 
ssh -i <private_key_pem_file> centos@<bastion_ip>

. 
Run the following command to download the required package:
sudo yum install -y nfs-utils

. 
Copy and save the following script as 
configureEFS.sh
:
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 "
    exit 1
fi
CURRENTDIR=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")";pwd)
suite_user_uid=$2
suite_user_gid=$3
mount_point=/mnt/efs
efs_server=$1
if [ ! -d $mount_point ]; then
    sudo mkdir -p $mount_point
fi
export TIMEOUT_FOR_SERVICES=120

Note
 The storage throughput hugely impacts the SMA performance. Low throughput storage might cause
slow response from the SMA system, or even an http error codes, such as 500, 504. Amazon EFS uses a credit
system to determine when file systems can burst. When in burst mode, the file system will drive throughput at its
baseline rate after running out of its credit. This throughput baseline rate is however too low for the SMA system
to run effectively. You need to keep monitoring your EFS bursting credits balance with AWS CloudWatch. See 
EFS

  Take a note of the value of 
FileServerDNSName
. It will be used in later steps.
