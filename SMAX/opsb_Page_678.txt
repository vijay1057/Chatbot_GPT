. 
Enter the host name or IPv4 address of the control plane node. You must use the same server name format for all
cluster nodes: either host name or IP address. You can enter the default host name. The host name must resolve to
an IPv4 address. If it's resolved to both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address, either contact the IT admin to delete the
resolved IPv6 address or enter the IPv4 address. Click 
Ignore warning
 to ignore the host checking errors. If you use
a customized host name, the host name must follow one of the hostname rules defined in 
Host Naming Rules and
RFC Documents
.

. 
Enter a user name. This must be the root user or a sudo user with the correct installation permission.
3
. 
Choose the verification mode as Password or Key-based and then enter your password or upload a private key file
respectively. Don't use non-UTF-8 characters for the password, such as "£". If you choose Key-based, you must first
enter a username and then upload a private key file when connecting the node with a private key file. Make sure that
the content of the public key is added into the 
authorized_keys
 file on the control plane node which you want to add.

. 
Scroll down to the 
Advanced Settings
 and type the storage device information. Choose 
Overlayfs
 as the device
type if the file system of 
$CDF_HOME
 is either "ext4" or "xfs" with "ftype=1". 
5
. 
Enter the Flannel IFace value if the control plane node has more than one network adapter. This must be a single
IPv4 address or name of the interface for Container inter-host communication. This is an optional step.
6
. 
Click 
Save
. The installer performs a system check before adding the control plane node. If an error occurs, the
control plane node configuration isn't saved.

Repeat the steps above to add the third control plane node.

Add worker nodes
1
. 
On the 
Worker Nodes configuration
 page, select the 
Allow suite workload to be deployed on the control plane
node
 option to deploy the workload on the control plane node (we recommend this option only for test environments and
not for production environments). Otherwise, click 
 
to add a worker node. The 
Worker Node Detail
 window is
displayed.
1
. 
Choose the required type. The node type is related to the sizing requirements of the node. The installer later will then
check whether the available sizing matches the node type you have chosen.
2
. 
Enter the FQDN or IPv4 address of a worker node. You must use the same server name format as the control plane
nodes for all the worker nodes: either host name or IP address. The host name must resolve to an IPv4 address. If it's
resolved to both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address, contact the IT admin to delete the resolved IPv6 address, or
enter the IPv4 address. If you use a customized host name, the host name must follow one of the hostname rules
defined in Host Naming Rules and RFC Documents.
3
. 
Type the User Name. This must be the root user or a sudo user with the correct installation permission.
4
. 
Choose a verification mode as Password or Key-based, and then enter your password or upload a private key file.
Don't use non-UTF-8 characters for the password, such as "£". If you are using a key-based authentication, you must
first enter a user name and then upload a private key file when connecting the node with a private key file. Make
sure that the content of the public key is added into the authorized_keys file on the worker node which you want to
add.
5
. 
Scroll down to the 
Advanced Settings
 and type the storage device information. Choose 
Overlayfs
 as the device
type if the file system of 
$CDF_HOME
 is either "ext4" or "xfs" with "ftype=1". 
6
. 
Type the Flannel IFace value if the worker node has more than one network adapter.
7
. 
Ensure that the 
Skip resource check
 option is clear. The best practice is to not skip resource checking.

Click

Repeat the steps above to add more worker nodes.

Make sure you don't delete any pod while you are adding control plane nodes and worker nodes or installing the suite, even
when the pod status is "Completed". For example, you mustn't delete any pod that resembles the following:
NAMESPACE    NAME                                        READY  STATUS            RESTARTS   AGE    IP             NODE                  NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
core         cdf-add-node-1555502049787                  0/1     Completed         0         8h      192.16.0.1       control1.mycompany.com      <none>          <none>
After the installation, if you use the command 
kubectl delete pod <pod name> 
to delete the pods in “Completed” status, all the
historical logging information associated with the execution of this pod will be deleted as well.
Note
If you want to change the network adapter, you should add the new node and remove the old one instead
of changing the Kubernetes configurations manually.
