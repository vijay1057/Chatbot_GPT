Disabling Defrag for Red Hat and CentOS Systems
You can modify the defrag utility to meet 
Vertica
 configuration requirements, or to optimize your system performance by
workload.
On all Red Hat/CentOS systems, you must disable the defrag utility to meet 
Vertica
 configuration requirements.
For 
SUSE 15.1, 
Vertica
 recommends that you enable defrag for optimized performance.
Recommended Settings by Workload for Red Hat 8/CentOS 8 and SUSE 15.1
Vertica
 recommends defrag settings to optimize performance by workload. The following table contains recommendations for
systems that primarily run concurrent queries (such as short-running dashboard queries), or sequential SELECT or load (COPY)
queries:

Disabling Defrag on Red Hat 6/CentOS 6 Systems
1
. 
Determine if defrag is enabled by running the following command:
cat /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/defrag
[always] madvise never
The setting returned in brackets is your current setting. If you are not using 
madvise
 or 
never
 as your defrag setting, then
you must disable defrag.

. 
Edit 
/etc/rc.local,
 and add the following script:
if test -f /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled; then
    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/defrag
fi
You must reboot your system for the setting to take effect, or run the following echo line to proceed with the install
without rebooting:
# echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/defrag

The steps to disable defrag on Red Hat 6/CentOS 6 systems differ from those used to disable defrag on Red Hat
7/CentOS 7 and Red Hat 8/CentOS 8.
