When containers are being started, they may need access to:
Securely stored configuration data
A server certificate to use for server processes
Tokens and certificates are generated dynamically and on demand. The token and certificates are renewed periodically.
The Pod specification for OMT AppHub and Suite containers contains annotations to get Vault tokens and server certificates.
The patterns used for this are init (get token and certificate) and sidecar (renew token and certificate) containers.
When a Pod starts, the init container is infused with a Vault access token. Then the init container requests a server certificate
from Vault.
While the Pod is running, a sidecar container continuously renews the short-lived Vault token and the longer-lived certificate.
Micro Focus uses a Kubernetes-vault implementation to supply containers with access tokens. This init container code was
updated to also generate server certificates.
Secrets (passwords, sensitive data, any other data the suite deems requiring secure storage) can be stored in Vault or in
Kubernetes secrets.
Vault: Hashicorp Vault: 
https://www.vaultproject.io/
; data is encrypted at rest in ETCD (or NFS)
Kubernetes secrets: 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/
 which are encrypted at rest in ETCD on an
OMT embedded Kubernetes cluster 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/
Accessing the secrets depends on the storage:
Vault: MF uses the following authentication mechanism
AppRole:
Mechanism: 
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/approle
Implementation: 
https://github.com/Boostport/kubernetes-vault
Details for app ID aka app role and secret ID:
App role: in Pod YAML
Secret ID:
Is a 128-bit purely random UUID
Available in Kubernetes Secret (1 secret per approle)
Kubernetes secrets: use the Kubernetes API through kubectl or REST API client
Kubectl: 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/
REST API client: token under /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/. The permissions are governed by the
role/rolebinding and/or clusterrole/clusterrolebinding of the service account that the Pod is running with.
The interface for Pods to read/write secrets is in both of the storages the same:
Get_secret / update_secret utilities in the container. These use either the Vault binary or Kubernetes REST API. The
communication is always TLS-secured (TLS 1.2) HTTPS with a strong set of ciphers only.
Use of customer certificates
For OMT AppHub Ingress controller
By default, the certificate used by the OMT AppHub Nginx (Ingress) that will be used to access OMT AppHub services on port
5443 is issued from the self-generated root CA.
If that is not acceptable, then a customer-issued certificate can be loaded. Refer to the OMT AppHub or Suite
installation/administration guide for details.
For Suite Ingress controller
Suite installations will install a separate Nginx (Ingress) instance that listens on port 443.
