Vertica server
Supported Operating Systems and Operating System Versions
Micro Focus
 supports the Vertica Analytic Database 10.0.x running on the following 64-bit operating systems and versions on
x86_x64 architecture. 
In general, 
Micro Focus
 provides support for the Vertica Analytic Database, not its host operating system, hardware, or other
environmental elements. However, 
Micro Focus
 makes an effort to ensure the success of its customers on recent versions of
the following popular operating systems for the x86_64 architecture.
When there are multiple minor versions supported for a major operating system release, 
Micro Focus
 recommends that you
run Vertica on the latest minor version listed in the supported versions list. For example, if you run Vertica on a Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7.x release, 
Micro Focus
 recommends you upgrade to or be running the latest supported RHEL 7.x release.
