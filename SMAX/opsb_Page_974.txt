Create application load balancer for Audit service
To enable SMAX and the Audit service to work together on AWS, you can configure an internal Application Load Balancer (ALB)
between the Ingress service of SMAX and the Ingress service of Audit. This best practice enables you to isolate internal
integration from external access. The diagram below depicts how the integration ALB sets up the connection between SMAX
and Audit:
Here are the details of the port:
Type: Ingress listener port for integration
Component: Audit
Example: 31050 
Prerequisites
Prepare a certificate
You will need a certificate for the ALB to achieve the integration between SMAX and Audit service. You can generate the
certificate using 
AWS Certificates Manager
, which AWS recommends. Before creating and configuring an ALB, you need to
prepare a new certificate using one of the following methods:
Request a certificate
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console in your target region.
2
. 
Navigate to 
Services
 > 
Certificate Manager
.
3
. 
Click 
Request a certificate
.
4
. 
Select 
Request a public certificate
 and click 
Request a certificate
.
5
. 
Specify your target domain name. You can use an asterisk (*) to request a wildcard certificate to protect several sites in
the same domain. For example, 
*.testsma-ng.org.
6
. 
Click 
Next
.
7
. 
Select 
DNS validation
 or 
Email validation
 according to your permission.
8
. 
Click 
Review
 and then click 
Confirm and request
.
9
. 
Click 
Continue
.
10
. 
Finish the certificate validation based on the method you just selected. For more information,
see 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/acm/validation
.
11
. 
Save the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate as it you will require it while creating the Audit ingress YAML.
Import a certificate
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console in your target region.
2
. 
Navigate to 
Services
 > 
Certificate Manager
.
3
. 
Click 
Import a certificate
.
4
. 
For 
Certificate body
, paste the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) encoded certificate.
5
. 
For 
Certificate private key
, paste the PEM encoded, unencrypted private key that matches the certificate's public key. 
Note: 
The target domain name (CN name) of the certificate must be the domain or full name of the FQDN you
will bind with the ALB in a later step.

Important: 
Currently, services integrated with AWS Certificate Manager support only the 
RSA_1024
 and 
R
SA_2048
 algorithms.
