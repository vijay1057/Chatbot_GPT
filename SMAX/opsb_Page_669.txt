(Optional) Upload images to an external registry
Note that when generating the download bundle, you need to replace 
-s <suite_name>
 with 
-s itsma
 in the command line. 
If you want to install OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) and a suite with an external registry, you must download and upload
the container images to the external registry before you run the 
install
 script.
Generate the download bundle
1
. 
Run the following command to change directory:
cd /<OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx-xxx>/tools/generate-download>
2
. 
Run the following command to display the command line options for the 
generate_download_bundle
 command:
./generate_download_bundle.sh -h
3
. 
Run the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 command together with the options required by your deployment. For example, run
the following command. Replace all the placeholders with the actual values.
./generate_download_bundle.sh -m <suite metadata> -s <suite name> -v <suite version> -o hpeswitom -d <offline-download.zip location>
For example:
./generate_download_bundle.sh -m /directory/containing/suite-metadata.tgz -s itsma -v 202x.xx -o hpeswitom -d /tmp
The 
offline-download.zip
 will be placed in the 
/tmp
 directory as specified.

You receive messages indicating that you have successfully generated the 
offline-download.zip
 file:
[INFO] 2020-04-30 17:58:46 : ** Generating the offline image download bundle ...
[INFO] 2020-04-30 17:58:50 : Completed generation of offline-download.zip in /tmp
The generated file contains the image download tool package. This tool downloads the OMT and suite images.
Download the OMT and suite images
1
. 
Log on to the first control plane node. If the first control plane node can't access Docker Hub, transfer the  
offline-download.z
ip
  file to a Linux server that can access Docker Hub.
2
. 
Extract the .zip package to a directory. If you can't access Docker Hub directly, set up the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. For
example, run the following commands to set the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Replace the placeholders with your actual server and
port. 
export http_proxy="<http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
export https_proxy="<https://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
3
. 
Go to the directory you extracted the 
offline-download.zip
 package into.
4
. 
Run the following command:
 
./downloadimages.sh -u <username>  -d <image download directory> -c on|off -o <org name>
Where:
Replace <
username
> with the Docker Hub username.
If you don't specify the credentials here, you will be prompted to specify them when you run the command.
<
image download directory
>: The directory where the container images will be downloaded. The default value is
Notes
To follow the steps in this section, you must have installed the 
zip
 Linux command on the node where you
run the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 script.
CA certificate verification is required between the registry server and its authentication server when
downloading and uploading images. If you didn't load the registry CA certificate into the truststore of your
download or upload machine, the download and upload process might fail.
To add a registry CA certificate into the truststore, refer to the following example. We take CentOS as an
example, for other OS, refer its official documentation.
1
. 
Copy the registry CA certificate to the folder: 
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
2
. 
Run the following command to update the registry CA certificate to truststore:
update-ca-trust extract
