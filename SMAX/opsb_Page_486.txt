Deploy OO capability
The suite admin needs to deploy the OO capability on a tenant before deploying Design and Deploy (DND) capability. To
deploy the OO capability on a tenant: 
1
. 
Log in to Suite Administration as suite-admin: https://<External Access Host>/bo.
2
. 
Click 
Tenants
 and then open the tenant.
3
. 
Select the 
Capability settings
 tab, and then click 
Deploy new capability
.
4
. 
In the 
Capability
 field, select 
Operations Orchestration
. 
5
. 
Enter the 
OO integration URL
 and 
OO login URL
.
For on-premises deployment, the 
OO integration URL
 and 
OO login URL 
are in the
format 
https://<OO_HOST>:<OO_PORT>
. For example, enter 
https://myoohost.example.com:9443
 in both
URL fields. 
6
. 
Click 
Next
. The system starts the validation of the URLs you entered.
The URLs must start with https or http and mustn't contain a trailing slash (/).
The system can connect to the OO controller in the backend by using the OO integration URL you entered. 
7
. 
If the URLs have passed the validation, a note appears below the URLs, indicating that it's impossible to remove the OO
capability once deployed. Select the checkbox for the note and then select 
Deploy
. 
8
. 
The deployment starts. You can check the deployment progress on the 
Operation history
 tab of the tenant.
9
. 
Wait several minutes until the deployment is 
Done
. 
10
. 
If the tenant admin has never logged in to the Agent interface, ask the tenant admin to log in: 
https://<External Access Host>/
saw/dashboard?TENANTID=<Tenant ID>
. This is because the system needs to replicate the relationship between the tenant
admin user and the OO Administrators group from IdM to the Agent interface, and so you need to make sure that the
tenant admin user already exists in the Agent interface.

. 
Set 
Enable capability
 to 
On
