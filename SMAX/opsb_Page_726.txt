Generate vault secrets
Generate vault secrets for the CMS charts
On the control plane node, perform the following tasks to generate vault secrets for the CMS charts:
1
. 
Run the following command:
$CDF_HOME/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n <
CMS NAMESPACE
> -c <
CMS CHART FILE
> -o <
SECRETS YAML FILE
>
Where:
For example:
/opt/cdf/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n cms-prod -c CMS_Helm_Chart-202x.xx/cms-helm-charts/charts/cms-1.x.0+20xxxx00.xxx.tgz -o cms-secrets.yaml
<
CMS NAMESPACE
>
 is the unique namespace of the CMS deployment. Use the namespace that you specified in the
"Create a new deployment for CMS" topic.
<
CMS CHART FILE
>
 is the tar file containing the CMS installation charts (
cms-1.x.0+20xxxx00.xxx.tgz
)
<
SECRETS YAML FILE
>
 is the YAML file that stores the CMS secrets. Specify the file name (for example, 
cms-
secrets.yaml
), and then the script will generate this YAML file after you run the script. You will need to use this file
when you run the command to install CMS later.

The Vault secret utility will prompt you for the following passwords. 
Key
Required?
Description
ITOM_DB_PASSWD_KEY
No
Internal PostgreSQL database root password.
idm_db_password
No
IdM database password.
IDM_SIGNING_KEY
No
IdM signing key.
HPSSO_INIT_STRING_KEY
No
LWSSO init string.
Important 
Useless in the current scenario because the
internal PostgreSQL database is only for deploying CMS in the
demo mode. However, in this version, you must enter
an arbitrary value conforming to the password policy to pass
the check by the script.

Important 
Useless in the current scenario because when
using the shared IdM solution, CMS uses the suite IdM. Press
Enter
 to get a random value and continue.
