chmod -R 755 /var/vols/itom/cms/data_volume
chmod -R 755 /var/vols/itom/cms/conf_volume
chmod -R 755 /var/vols/itom/cms/log_volume

Create a custom values.yaml file
Important 
The values of 
<user>
 and 
<fsGroup>
 configured here must be the same as the values for the
global.securityContext.user
 and
 global.securityContext.fsGroup
 parameters when you create
your custom 
my-values.yaml
 file for the CMS deployment in the later step.  That is, if you use the values in
this example (
100001 
for <user> and 
200001 
for <fsGroup>) instead of the default value 
1999
, you must
also change the values for 
global.securityContext.user
 and
 global.securityContext.fsGroup 
to
100001 
and 
200001 
in your custom 
my-values.yaml
 file.
