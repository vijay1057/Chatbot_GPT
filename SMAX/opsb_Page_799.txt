The numbers in the table are meant to be approximate for a given deployment
environment, but not exact. For example, a Small environment may only create 5
offerings, or 10 per category, although the table lists a representative number of
20. In your anticipated environment, you may find the expected numbers of
tenants to span multiple profile definitions (for example, the number of active
subscriptions may fit the Small deployment, while the number of offerings may fit
the Medium profile). In such a case, select the profile that seems most
representative of your anticipated environment, with the number of total
subscriptions of particular importance. The sizing configuration is based on the
results of in-house performance testing against these deployment environments.
In general, you should find the need to tune the configuration parameters after
the installation, as the components can be scaled manually as needed, to support
the size of the environment you have specified.

Before enabling and using the Design and Deploy functionality, you should install and enable Operations Orchestration(OO)
Containerized capability. 
Use the table below to plan the additional hardware resources for each individual DND instance. The additional hardware
resources for DND are the total of the additional hardware resources for all DND instances.
For OO, choose one of the following options for setting up a database:
To set up OO with a common database, you can choose to connect OO to the same database instance as the rest of the
suite components. For hardware requirements, see the table below 
Standard hardware requirements with a
common database.
Important:
On any AWS RDS instance type, the default value of the 
max_connections
 parameter is calculated based on
formula: 
LEAST({DBInstanceClassMemory/9531392}, 5000)
. For details, see Amazon documentation 
here
.
To set the 
max_connections
 parameter of the RDS instance of OO to the values specified in the following table, you
need to edit the parameter group associated with the RDS instance and, if the RDS instance was created before the
parameter change, restart the RDS instance.
To determine standard hardware requirements with a dedicated database for OO, see 
Additional hardware
requirements for OO Containerized with a dedicated database
 section.
To deploy OO for 5-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here
.
To deploy OO for 20-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here

 For EBS backend storage, including EBS backend storage used for OS storage and overlay2, and EBS backend RDS services,
you may switch to IO1 instead of GP2 for better performance. For more details, see 
EBS storage
 and 
RDS Storage
. 
Important: 
When you are installing DND functionality on an existing setup, you need to reconfigure the
hardware resources as per the recommendations given in the below tables to accommodate the required
additional resources. 
Note
: For EFS and Postgres HA configuration, follow the recommendations provided in vendor-specific
