Two or three subnets should sit in at least two Availability Zones, better to sit in three Availability Zones, configured as
public subnets with the following components configured or other components enabling the provisioning of internet-facing
load balancers in the subnets (usually on a different VPC peered with the private VPC).
NAT gateway
a
. 
Open the Amazon VPC console at 
https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home
.
b
. 
Click 
NAT Gateways > Create NAT Gateway
.
c
. 
Select a public subnet in the peered public VPC.
d
. 
Associate Elastic IP.
e
. 
Click 
Create a NAT Gateway
.
f
. 
After creating the NAT gateway, add a NAT gateway route entry in the route table associated with the private
subnets.
Internet gateway
a
. 
On the public VPC, go to the 
Internet Gateway
 console
b
. 
Click 
Create internet gateway
 if there is no Internet gateway attached to it. The system automatically creates
two route tables after the VPC is created successfully. One of the tables automatically attaches to the Internet
gateway. You need to name the two route tables respectively. For example, name one route table 
example-
sma-public-subnet-routetable
 and it attaches to the Internet gateway, and name another route table
example-sma-private-subnet-routetable
.
