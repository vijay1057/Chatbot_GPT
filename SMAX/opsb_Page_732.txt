Associate CMS SuperAdmin role
When the system provisions a CMS customer, the CMS out-of-the-box (OOTB) roles with built-in permissions are automatically
seeded in IdM. The application field of these seeded CMS roles is "CMDB" (as shown in the following screenshot).
For details of the CMS OOTB roles, see 
CMS out-of-the-box roles
.
The suite admin can do CMS pre-authorization in IdM by associating these CMS OOTB roles to corresponding IdM groups so that
the suite admin doesn't need to grant permissions to the roles in CMS manually but mapping to the built-in permissions. Take
the shared IdM solution as an example, you can use the seeded CMS OOTB SuperAdmin role directly without the need of
creating a new CMS Super Admin role in IdM manually.

1
. 
Log in to the suite IdM (
https://
<External_Access_Host>
/idm-admin
) as 
suite-admin
, and then access
the 
SYSBO 
organization.
2
. 
Go to 
Groups
 in the navigation pane, click the 
administrators
 group, and then click  
 
 in the toolbar. The 
Group
Settings
 page opens.
3
. 
In the 
Group Settings
 section, go to the 
Associated Roles
 field, search for and click the OOTB role 
SuperAdmin
with the "CMDB" application field, and then associate it to the group.
4
. 
Click 
SAVE
. 
Now you can access CMS with the 
suite-admin
 account. Replace 
<EXTERNAL_ACCESS_HOST> 
and 
<PORT> 
with the
values that you specify for the
 global.externalAccessHost 
and 
global.externalAccessPort
 parameters in 
my-
values.yaml
.

Next step
After you install the containerized CMS, you can continue with the 
Associate SMAX tenants with UCMDB customers for Single
Sign-On
 task and other subsequent tasks to enable Native SACM. 
Note 
After you associate the OOTB role 
SuperAdmin 
with the "CMDB" application field to the
administrators 
group, the users under this group are pre-authorized with CMS super admin permissions. To
perform administrative tasks in CMS, you can use 
suite-admin
 as the CMS Provider customer super admin (with
the 
Server Administrator Privileges
 flag set and granted SuperAdmin role). The 
suite-admin 
can also log in
to the JMX console with full access and perform global JMX operations, such as creating customers and
deleting customers.
