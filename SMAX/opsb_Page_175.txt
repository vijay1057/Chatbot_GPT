Incidents by service
Incident Volume in the Past Month
Then we can add a few views for our specific service desks to help them out. I’ll set one up to show all the critical incidents,
then we can work with the Incident managers to create exactly what they need.
Incident Models
Another tool we have for incident management is the concept of incident models. Similar to the offerings we have in request
management, incident models contain the information to guide our agents through the process of solving common types of
Incidents. This information could include:
Default values for any field (“A production database incident always has an impact of ‘Enterprise’”)
A list of tasks necessary to resolve the incident
Unique information needed for this type of incident defined as user options (“for major incidents, the agent needs to enter
a conference line number”)
Any business rules specific to this type of incident (from sending extra notifications to bringing in information from an
external system)
As we run into common or similar incidents, our incident managers can create these Models to improve our responsiveness
going forward. For now, we can just create a ‘major incident’ model that when selected will:
Set the impact and urgency of the incident to the highest levels
Create tasks for the owner of the affected service to start a conference line and send notifications to our critical response
team
Trigger an extra review by our problem management team after the incident is resolved
All of the details around 
incident models
 can be found online as well.
