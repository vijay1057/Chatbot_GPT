Monitoring
Overview
Systems that run Containerd and Kubernetes can be monitored in various ways.
Containerd provides basic runtime metrics through the use of “crictl stats”.
In OMT, monitoring occurs at the Kubernetes level.
The monitoring data is collected from Kubelet which acts as an abstraction layer for particular container runtime engines.
OMT embedded Kubernetes includes Metrics Server for cluster-wide monitoring. Both talk directly to Kubernetes metrics
endpoints where the raw data is provided by the Kubelet.
The Kubelet gets this information from cAdvisor.
The Kubelet information is then aggregated by Metrics Server and visualized via the Kubernetes dashboard.

Additional OMT monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana
Through an optional capability install additional monitoring packages are available for download.
OMT deploys Prometheus to collect metrics and visualises the data through Grafana.
Metrics are supplied by the application and the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure.
