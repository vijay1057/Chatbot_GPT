Swap Space Requirements
Vertica
 requires at least 2 GB swap partition regardless of the amount of RAM installed on your system. The installer reports
this issue with identifier 
S0180
.
For typical installations 
Vertica
 recommends that you partition your system with a 2GB primary partition for swap regardless of
the amount of installed RAM. Larger swap space is acceptable, but unnecessary.
If you do not have at least a 2 GB swap partition then you may experience performance issues when running 
Vertica
.
You typically define the swap partition when you install Linux. See your platform’s documentation for details on configuring the
swap partition.
Note
Do not place a swap file on a disk containing the 
Vertica
 data files. If a host has only two disks (boot and data),
put the swap file on the boot disk.
