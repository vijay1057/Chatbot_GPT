General Hardware and OS Requirements and
Recommendations
Hardware Recommendations
The 
Vertica Analytics Platform
 is based on a massively parallel processing (MPP), shared-nothing architecture, in which the
query processing workload is divided among all nodes of the Vertica database. 
Micro Focus
 highly recommends using a
homogeneous hardware configuration for your 
Vertica
 cluster; that is, each node of the cluster should be similar in CPU, clock
speed, number of cores, memory, and operating system version.
Note that 
Micro Focus
 has not tested 
Vertica
 on clusters made up of nodes with disparate hardware specifications. While it is
expected that a 
Vertica
 database would functionally work in a mixed hardware configuration, performance will most certainly
be limited to that of the slowest node in the cluster.
Detailed hardware recommendations are available in 
Recommendations for Sizing Vertica Nodes and Clusters
 (formerly the
Vertica Hardware Planning Guide).
Platform OS Requirements
You must verify that your servers meet the platform requirements described in 
Vertica Server and Vertica Management
Console
.
Verify Sudo
Vertica
 uses the sudo command during installation and some administrative tasks. Ensure that sudo is available on all hosts
with the following command:
# which sudo
/usr/bin/sudo
If sudo is not installed, on all hosts, follow the instructions in 
How to Enable sudo on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
.
When you use sudo to install 
Vertica
, the user that performs the installation must have privileges on all nodes in the cluster.
Configuring sudo with privileges for the individual commands can be a tedious and error-prone process; thus, the 
Vertica
documentation does not include every possible sudo command that you can include in the sudoers file. Instead, 
Vertica
recommends that you temporarily elevate the sudo user to have all privileges for the duration of the install.
To allow root sudo access on all commands as any user on any machine, use visudo as root to edit the 
/etc/sudoers
 file and add
this line:
## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root   ALL=(ALL) ALL 
After the installation completes, remove (or reset) sudo privileges to the pre-installation settings.
Deploy 
Vertica
 as the only active process on each host—other than Linux processes or software explicitly
approved by 
Vertica
. 
Vertica
 cannot be colocated with other software. Remove or disable all non-essential
applications from cluster hosts.
Note
See the sudoers and visudo man pages for the details on how to write/modify a sudoers file.
