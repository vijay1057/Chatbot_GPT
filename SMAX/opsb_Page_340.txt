The most important row is the properties row to create the incident. There are key bits of information required from SMAX to
do this. Most notably what is the user ID that is creating the incident, what service is affected by this incident and where
should this incident be assigned to. All these values need the IDs providing, so you’ll need to check within your own SMAX
environment in order to provide these details.
For the Results tab, enter the details below:
