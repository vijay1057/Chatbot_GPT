Install and configure Vertica database
SMAX uses an internal Vertica datastore component to store data related to Capacity Optimization, Budget Quota
Management, and Showback. Storage of data other than that of SMAX within this database isn't allowed and requires a
separate purchase of Vertica licenses.
SMAX supports the installation of Vertica on multiple nodes. For the Vertica database version that SMAX supports, see the
System requirements.
