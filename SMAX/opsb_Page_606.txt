Check for Swappiness
The swappiness kernel parameter defines the amount, and how often, the kernel copies RAM contents to a swap space. 
Vertica
recommends a value of 1. The installer reports any swappiness issues with identifier 
S0112
.
To set the swappiness value add or update the following in 
/etc/sysctl.conf
:
vm.swappiness = 1
This also ensures that the value persists after a reboot.
You can check the swappiness value as follows:
cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
If necessary, you change the swappiness value at runtime by logging in as root and running the following:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
