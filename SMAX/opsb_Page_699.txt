Replace the following placeholders with the related FQDNs and change your server certificate and server key paths:
<control plane node 1>: FQDN of the first control plane node
<control plane node 2>: FQDN of the second control plane node
<control plane node 3>: FQDN of the third control plane node
<external access host>: the external access hostname of the suite (for ports 5443 and 443)
/root/server.crt and /root/server.key (for ports 5443 and 443): paths of the server certificate and server key files that you
have generated for nginx-smax (
server.crt
 and 
server.key
)
