Test Scenario 1: Simulate HAProxy Service problem.
Test Purpose to check:
->The virtual IP will switch to the BACKUP when the HAProxy on the MASTER is shut down.
->The virtual IP will not switch back to haproxy1 when the HAProxy goes alive on it. Nopreempt will work. It will avoid the unnecessary connection
switch.
a
. 
On the haproxy1, run the following command:
#systemctl stop haproxy
#journalctl -u keepalived -f
The Keepalived on this host is "Entering FAULT STATE."
The Virtual IP is removed.
b
. 
On the haproxy2, run command:
#journalctl -u keepalived -f
The Keepalived on this host is "Entering MASTER STATE."
The gratuitous ARP is sent for the virtual IP (16.155.194.119).
c
. 
On the haproxy1, run the following command:
#systemctl start haproxy
#journalctl -u keepalived -f
The Keepalived on this host is "Entering BACKUP STATE."
The gratuitous ARP is sent for the haproxy1 IP address (16.155.194.54) but not for the virtual IP (16.155.194.119).
#ip addr show dev ens160
Configure a hardware load balancer
Alternatively, you can deploy a hardware load balancer to replace HAProxy. The following screenshots are a typical example
that demonstrates how to connect to the PostgreSQL cluster:
Before you start, assign a virtual address to the physical address of the F5 network interface. The newly added virtual address
will be used for the virtual server later on.
