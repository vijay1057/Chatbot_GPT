This directory is used by the operating system as a temporary location and is used for some application files. The minimum
recommended size for this directory is 10 GB on all of your systems. In the install.properties setup file, it's possible to specify
an alternative location for temporary installation files (TMP_FOLDER), which would reduce this requirement if for some reason
/tmp must be smaller.
Directory to contain the offline download of the images
The installation process requires you to download the images to the first control plane node or download them on a separate
Containerd system and copy them to the first control plane node. You can specify a directory for the download images or use
the default directory /var/opt/cdf/offline. The image processing done by 
uploadimages.sh
 requires up to 2 times of the image
size in the target directory. This space is required only temporarily on the first control plane node and not needed on any other
node. You can remove the images once the installation is done. If you choose to use the default /var/opt/cdf/offline directory,
then ensure that you have the 2 times of the OMT and suite image size under /var/opt/cdf/offline under the first control plane
node.
OMT home and OMT runtime directory
These can be in any location of your choice. By default they're both under /opt (/opt/cdf and /opt/cdf/data). If you choose to
install into a different home location or change the runtime directory location, then you need to edit the corresponding 
CDF_HO
ME
 and the 
RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME
 parameters in the 
install.properties
 file to point to the directories you wish to use. You can
configure those parameters along with others while completing the preparation tasks.
When the OMT runtime directory (specified for 
RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME) 
uses a different directory from $CDF_HOME, the disk
requirement for the 
RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME
 specified directory is only for the use of  "overlayfs". 
We recommend leaving these as the default.
