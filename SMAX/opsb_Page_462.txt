Why search results don't match the search keyword
Sometimes, a search might return results that don't seem to match the required keyword. For example, if you search "printer",
a seemingly irrelevant result such as "order laptop backpack" might appear. This is because some indexed fields other than
Title, Description, and ID are used to search for the keyword.
To find the indexed field that matches the search keyword, follow these steps:
1
. 
Go to the 
saw-dah
 log folders (/var/vols/itom/itsma/smartanalytics-volume/logs/idol/saw/dah/smarta-saw-dah-<n>), and
find the 
action.log
 file.
2
. 
Open the file and locate the action that has the 
maxresult=60
 string. The 
Text
 field indicates the search keyword.
3
. 
Copy the entire action and use a URL decoding tool to decode this query.
4
. 
Remove 
responseFormat=json&
 from the decoded query, and then copy the query to a text editor.
5
. 
Go to Service Management, select 
Configurations
 > 
Smart Analytics
, and then click 
GO TO SMART ANALYTICS
.
6
. 
In Smart Analytics Assistant, double-click 
XService DAH
, and then replace 
action=GetStatus
 in the text box with your
decoded query.
7
. 
Run this action to get the response result.
8
. 
Search 
printer
 in the result. You will find the indexed field that contains your keyword. In this example, it's the 
PUBLIC-
COMMENTS
 field.
