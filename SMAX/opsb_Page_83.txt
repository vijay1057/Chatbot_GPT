If you set up the custom domain (short URL) for a tenant, the users with
the OAuth authentication type can only use the custom domain as the
login URL. The original URL (long URL) no longer works for the OAuth
users.

When users with the OAuth authentication type log out of the system,
they can't see the tenant 
Logout
 page with the 
LOG IN
 button to log
in again. As a result, if the users want to log in to the tenant again,
they have to manually enter the tenant URL.
