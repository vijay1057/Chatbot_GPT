Launch RDS for Audit service
Use the SMAX Relational Database Service (RDS) instance and create a database for the Audit service.
Set up PostgreSQL database for Audit service on the RDS instance
Make sure you enable SSL on the PostgreSQL because Audit uses SSL to communicate with PostgreSQL.
Below are sample SQL commands for creating a user and a database for a service:
1
. 
Log in to the bastion node and then run the following command to connect to the PostgreSQL instance:
psql -h <RDSEndpointAddress> -p <RDSEndpointPort> -U <postgres admin> -d postgres
2
. 
Run the following commands to create the databases and the users used by the Audit service:
CREATE USER <USERNAME> PASSWORD '<PASSWORD>';
grant <USERNAME> to <PostgresSQL admin>;
CREATE DATABASE <DBNAME> OWNER <USERNAME>;   
<PASSWORD>
 for the database user should be at least 16 characters long and have alphanumeric characters, at least
one lower case letter, at least one upper case letter, and at least one digit.
For example,
CREATE USER auditdbuser PASSWORD 'Password@Audit1234';
grant auditdbuser to postgres;
CREATE DATABASE auditdb OWNER auditdbuser;
