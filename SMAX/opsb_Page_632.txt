To enable swap, perform the following steps on each of the control plane nodes and worker nodes:
1
. 
Log in to the server as root or a sudo user.
2
. 
Run the following command to check the swap status:
free
3
. 
If swap is disabled, the command returns a result that resembles the following (all swap values are zero):
 total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:       32003164     1886596    15282264       13024    14834304    29508624
Swap:             0           0           0
4
. 
Edit the /etc/fstab file:
vi /etc/fstab
Uncomment the swap configuration line if it is commented out.
5
. 
Run the following command to enable swap:
swapon -a
6
. 
Check that swap is enabled:
free
The command output should resemble the following:
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:       32003164      322200    31441228       11532      239736    31297920
Swap:      16383996           0    16383996

Note: For SMA, you are recommended to use a swap size that is at least half of the RAM size of the machine.
Caution: Once swap is enabled, you must set the
 FAIL_SWAP_ON
 parameter in the 
install.properties
 file to false
(default: true). Failure to do so will cause the installation to fail.
