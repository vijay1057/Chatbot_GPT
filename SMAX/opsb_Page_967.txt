After you have ran the script, verify that the audit repositories are uploaded into AWS ECR by following these steps:
1
. 
Type audit in the 
Private/Public repositories
 search box in 
Amazon ECR
 > 
Repositories
 section.
2
. 
Make sure you see entries for audit on the page.
Download and upload images
1
. 
Copy the 
smax-image-transfer.py
 file from the following directory:
Cloud Deployment x.x.x/byok
 to OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx
/scripts
2
. 
Run the following commands to retrieve the username and password of EC, if you've installed AWS CLI version 1 when
configuring bastion:
cd OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
dockerLogin=$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region <ecr_region>)
ecrUserName=$(echo $dockerLogin | awk '{print $4}')
ecrUserPassword=$(echo $dockerLogin | awk '{print $6}')
ecrURL=$(echo $dockerLogin | awk '{print $7}' | awk -F/ '{print $3}')
3
. 
Run the following commands to retrieve the username and password of EC, if you've installed AWS CLI version 2 when
configuring bastion:
cd OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
ecrUserName=AWS
ecrUserPassword=$(aws ecr get-login-password)
ecrURL=<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
4
. 
Run the following command to transfer images from the source registry to your own registry. 
 python3 smax-image-transfer.py -sr <source_registry> -su <source_username> -sp <source_password> -so <source_orgname> -tr <target_registry> -tu <target_username> -tp <target_password> -to <target_orgname> 
Where,
<ecr_region> is the region where you specified to put your ECR repositories.
<source_username> is the user name of the source docker registry. Obtain it from support team if you use Docker Hub, or
contact the admin of the registry.
<source_password> is the password of the source docker registry. Obtain it from support team if you use Docker Hub, or
contact the admin of the registry.
<source_registry> is the URL of the source registry. For example, 
registry.hub.docker.com
.
<source_orgname> is the organization name in the source docker registry. It's 
hpeswitom
 if you use Docker Hub, or contact
the admin of the registry.
<target_orgname> is the organization name in the target docker registry, which you can obtain from the admin of the registry.
