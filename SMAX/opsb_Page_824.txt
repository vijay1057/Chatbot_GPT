To deploy OMT and the suite on AWS with EKS, you must prepare a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) first and place the other
resources in this prepared VPC.
There are three options as described below.
The first two options are for the scenario where your IT policy allows you to deploy public subnets with private subnets in a
single VPC and you need to follow the architecture mentioned in 
Before you begin
.
The third option is for the scenarios where your IT policy doesn't allow public subnets to work with private subnets in a single
VPC and you have the flexibility to deploy on different cloud deployments on AWS. However, you need to work with your
IT/Network administrator to figure out the detailed solutions for this deployment. The below diagram is one example for your
reference.
