Enabling or Disabling Transparent Hugepages
You can modify transparent hugepages to meet 
Vertica
 configuration requirements:
For Red Hat 7/CentOS 7 and Amazon Linux 2.0, you must enable transparent hugepages. The installer reports this issue
with the identifier: 
S0312
.
For Red Hat 8/CentOS 8 and SUSE 15.1, 
Vertica
 provides recommended settings to optimize your system performance by
workload.
For all other systems, you must disable transparent hugepages or set them to 
madvise
. The installer reports this issue
with the identifier: 
S0310
.
Recommended Settings by Workload for Red Hat 8/CentOS 8 and SUSE 15.1
Vertica
 recommends transparent hugepages settings to optimize performance by workload. The following table contains
recommendations for systems that primarily run concurrent queries (such as short-running dashboard queries), or sequential
SELECT or load (COPY) queries:
Operating System
Concurrent
Sequential
Important Notes
Red Hat 8.0/CentOS 8.0

SUSE 15.1

Additionally, 
Vertica
 recommends the following 
khugepaged
settings to optimize for each workload:
Concurrent Workloads:
 
Disable 
khugepaged
 with the following command:
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/defrag
Sequential Workloads:
 
Enable 
khugepaged
 with the following command:
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/defrag
See 
Enabling or Disabling Defrag
 for additional settings that optimize your system performance by workload.
Disabling Transparent Hugepages on Red Hat 6/CentOS 6 Systems
Determine if transparent hugepages is enabled. To do so, run the following command.
cat /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled
[always] madvise never
The setting returned in brackets is your current setting.
If you are not using 
madvise
 or never as your transparent hugepage setting, then you can disable transparent hugepages in
one of two ways:
Edit your boot loader (for example 
/etc/grub.conf
). Typically, you add the following to the end of the kernel line. However,
consult the documentation for your system before editing your boot loader configuration.
transparent_hugepage=never
Edit 
/etc/rc.local
 and add the following script. 
if test -f /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled; then
   echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled
fi
For systems that do not support 
/etc/rc.local
, use the equivalent startup script that is run after the destination runlevel has been
reached. For example SuSE uses 
/etc/init.d/after.local
.
Regardless of which approach you choose, you must reboot your system for the setting to take effect, or run the following
echo line to proceed with the install without rebooting:
If you are using Red Hat 7/CentOS 7, Red Hat 8/CentOS 8, SUSE 15.1, or Amazon Linux 2.0, you must enable,
rather than disable transparent hugepages. See: 
Enabling Transparent Hugepages on Red Hat 7/8, CentOS 7/8,
SUSE 15.1, and Amazon Linux 2.0
