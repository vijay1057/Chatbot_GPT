Bundling of suite and OMT
In suite installations using Micro Focus bespoke installation mechanism, OMT is only installed when the 1st ITOM Suite is
installed. The sole purpose of OMT is to manage the installation and lifecycle of an ITOM suite. The installation process of Suite
and OMT has been merged into a seamless flow.
In installs of a Helm-charted ITOM suite, and if the OMT embedded Kubernetes is used, then the embedded Kubernetes cluster
is installed completely 1st, followed by creation of a deployment in which the ITOM suite is then installed using its Helm chart
and the OMT AppHub or Helm CLI.
Suite deployment architecture
A Suite deployment is fully containerized. (*)
Suite functionality is split into capabilities which themselves have been split into front- and backend services.
A Suite deployment always also has installation, configuration and administration services.
Actual services (front- or backend) are modeled using Kubernetes controllers such as Deployment or Replication Controllers.
These deploy a number of Pods (1 to 
n
, the unit of scheduling in Kubernetes) which in turn consist of 1 to 
n
 containers.
Each container runs (typically) a single process such as web server or a database engine.
A simplified architecture may look like this:
Figure - Simplified application architecture
A sample deployment of a Suite is shown below.
It shows how public endpoints are defined using Ingress rules and exposed via the Ingress controller and the resulting unified
URL namespace that this creates. The Suite functionality is grouped into capabilities, implemented as front- and backend
services.
