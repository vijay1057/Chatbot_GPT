Create a deployment
You should deploy Audit service in a separate namespace. You can use the tool provided by OPTIC Management Toolkit
(OMT) to create an Audit deployment. This tool gets a unique namespace for Audit, default certificate, and service account
prepared for installing the Audit Helm charts.
1
. 
Log in to the first control plane as a root user.
2
. 
Run the following commands to create an Audit service deployment.
cd $CDF_HOME/scripts
cdfctl deployment create -d <Audit Deployment Name> [-n <Audit Namespace>]
or
$cdfctl deployment create -d <Audit Deployment Name> -n ${Audit Namespace} -t helm
For example:
cd $CDF_HOME/scripts
cdfctl deployment create -d audit-prod
or
cdfctl deployment create -d auditns -n auditns -t helm
The 
-n
 option is optional. If you don't specify this option, the value defaults to the deployment name (the value of the 
-
d
 option). You can run the 
./cdfctl.sh deployment -h
 command to view other options.
When the application deployment is successful, you will see this message: "Successfully created deployment 
<name>
".
