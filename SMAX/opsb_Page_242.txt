Review Interfaces and Integrations
Existing interfaces/integrations with Service Manager that must continue to work with SMAX need to be identified.
Due to specific differences between how Service Manager and SMAX handle integrations, special attention is
needed when investigating these areas.
It is recommended to document all 
Micro Focus
 owned integrations and verify these integrations are also available
with SMAX. These integrations may include but are not limited to:
OMi
UCMDB
OO
As a second step, document all other integrations and identify what method is used to integrate these 3rd party
products with SMAX. Possible methods include:
Web Service Integration
Connect IT
LDAP Integration
SCAUTO
Depending on these findings, the decision on how to implement these integrations in SMAX must be made. Some
differences in how SMAX implements integrations may help guide these decisions. These differences include:
SCAUTO is not supported
SMAX Web Service API only uses REST (no SOAP support)
☐ 
Review custom documentation
Examine all current custom documentation to gather information on current processes, system setup, and ways of
working.
Reviewing the documentation will help to identify differences in the current processes in Service Manager compared
to SMAX. Based on any differences discovered, determine how to modify processes where necessary to better fit
the SMAX workflows. Identify any custom documentation that must be rewritten for the move to SMAX
