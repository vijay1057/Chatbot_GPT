Setting up Request Management
Request management handles the end to end process of receiving a request from an end user and fulfilling it. A request
management process reduces the load on agents by allowing end users to fulfill their own requests without agent involvement
either by automating common request offerings (such as password resets) or providing knowledge that will allow the end user
to answer a question by themselves. For more information, please read the 
Request Management
 chapter in the Getting
Started guide.

The Service Catalog
To consume the services IT provides, the end users need to have a way of discovering the services available and what actions
or requests they can perform against them. The service catalog provides the means of creating those available choices for
both the Service Management Automation Service Portal (accessed by the end users) and request management (accessed by
the agents). 
Before creating your Service Catalog, we recommend reading the 
associated chapter
 in the Getting Started guide.
