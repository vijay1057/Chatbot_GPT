/var/opt/cdf/offline.
The 
-c
 option is used to verify the digital signature of the images during the download. The default setting is off,
which doesn't verify the signature.
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, this is 
hpeswit
om.
 This option is mandatory if you aren't using the default organization name.
To see the full list of options for the 
downloadimages.sh
 command, run the following command:
./downloadimages.sh –h
The command also has a 
-p
 option to provide your password. The 
-p
  option doesn't support single quotes (don't include
single quotes in the password).
Upload the images
Follow these steps to upload the installation images to your external image registry:
1
. 
Log on to one of the control plane nodes. The node must be able to connect to the external registry.
2
. 
Go to the directory you extracted the 
offline-download.zip
 package into.
3
. 
Run the following command to upload the suite images to the external registry:
./uploadimages.sh -r <image repository URL> -u <username>  -d <image download directory> -o <org name>
Where:
Replace 
<image repository URL>
 with the URL of the external registry where the images will be uploaded. You can
format the URL with the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, or not specify a protocol (in this case, the protocol defaults to
HTTPS). For example: 
image-registry.com:443
, 
http://image-registry.com
, or 
https://image-registry.com
.
Replace 
<username>
 with the registry username.  
If you don't specify the credentials here, you will be prompted to specify them when you run the command.
<image download directory>
: The directory to which you downloaded the container images. The default value is
/var/opt/cdf/offline. Specify the 
-d 
option if the images aren't in the 
/var/opt/cdf/offline/
 directory. You can use the 
-d
option multiple times when the images are in different directories. The images can be the images downloaded by the
downloadimages.sh
 or saved by 
docker save
. For the images saved by 
docker save
, only .tar, .tgz, and .tar.gz images are
supported. Make sure the image file type matches the file extension. 
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, this is 
hpeswit
om.
 This option is mandatory if you aren't using the default organization name.
To see the full list of options for the 
uploadimages.sh
 command, run the following command:
./uploadimages.sh -h 
4
. 
Wait until the images are successfully uploaded. Your terminal resembles the following:
Upload-process successfully completed.
