Create Application Load Balancer for integration
To enable SMAX and the containerized CMS to work together on AWS, we recommend that you configure an internal
Application Load Balancer (ALB) between the Ingress service of SMAX and the Ingress service of CMS. This best practice
enables you to isolate internal integration from external access.
The diagram below depicts how the integration ALB sets up the connection between SMAX and CMS:
Here are the details of the ports:

Prerequisites
Prepare a certificate
A certificate for the Application Load Balancer will be used to achieve the integration between SMAX and CMS. The certificate
can be generated by 
AWS Certificates Manager
, which is recommended by AWS. Before creating and configuring an ALB,
you need to prepare a new certificate using one of the following methods:
Note
: The target domain name (CN name) of the certificate must be the domain or full name of the FQDN you will bind with
the ALB in a later step.
Request a certificate
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console in your target region.
2
. 
Navigate to 
Services
 > 
Certificate Manager
.
3
. 
Click 
Request a certificate
.
4
. 
Select 
Request a public certificate
 and click 
Request a certificate
.
5
. 
Specify your target domain name. You can use an asterisk (*) to request a wildcard certificate to protect several sites in
the same domain. For example, 
*.testsma-ng.org.

. 
Select 
DNS validation
 or 
Email validation
 according to your permission.

Import a certificate
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console in your target region.
2
. 
Navigate to 
Services
 > 
Certificate Manager
.
3
. 
Click 
Import a certificate
.
4
. 
For 
Certificate body
, paste the PEM-encoded certificate.
5
. 
For 
Certificate private key
, paste the PEM-encoded, unencrypted private key that matches the certificate's public key. 
Important:
 Currently, services integrated with AWS Certificate Manager support only
the 
RSA_1024
 and 
RSA_2048
 algorithms.
6
. 
(Optional) For 
Certificate chain
, paste the PEM-encoded certificate chain.

Create an Ingress for integration between CMS and SMAX 
AWS Application Load Balancer is used to serve end users to access the suite from web browsers. You need to create an
Application Load Balancer for integration and add a listener to the ALB for CMS and SMAX respectively during the creation.
