Flannel uses the default gateway to create packet routing on the nodes for communication. To enable network communication
across all the cluster nodes, you must ensure localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1 on all control plane and worker nodes. To do this,
follow these steps:  
1
. 
Run the following command to check your localhost setting:
 
grep -v '^\s*#' /etc/hosts 2>/dev/null | grep -E '\slocalhost$|\slocalhost\s'
If there is no return value, run the following command to set the default route setting:
echo "127.0.0.1 localhost" >> /etc/hosts   
 
2
. 
Open the 
/etc/hosts
 file with a supported editor and check the configurations in the file. Make sure that localhost
resolves to 127.0.0.1. 
For example:
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
If you want to enable IPv4/IPv6 dual stack for OMT installation, make sure the localhost resolves to 
::1
 in 
/etc/hosts
 file. For
example, 
::1 localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
