Download and upload container images for OO
Before you deploy the suite, you need to download the required images from Docker Hub or other registries and then upload
the images to your registry.
Generate the image set
Before downloading and uploading the images, you need to generate the image set with the following steps on the bastion
node:
1
. 
Run the following command to change directory:
cd OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/tools/generate-download
2
. 
Run the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 script together with the options required by your deployment to generate the
download bundle zip:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart /home/centos/oo_chart/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.x/oo-helm-charts/charts/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.x.tgz -o <org name> [-d <destination dir>]
Where:
<OO helm chart file>
: The absolute path to the OO Helm chart archive. Example: 
oo-1.0.x+2022xx01-xx/oo-helm-charts/chart
s/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx.tgz
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, it's 
hpeswito
m
.
<destination dir>
: The directory path for the output .zip file. The default location is the current directory.
The 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 compares the images needed by the suite with the images that already exist in the
cluster, and generates a .zip file, 
offline-download.zip
. This 
offline-download.zip
 file enables you to download the
required images from Docker Hub.
For example:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart oo-1.0.x+2022xx01-xx/oo-helm-charts/charts/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx.tgz -o hpeswitom
The 
offline-download.zip
 file gets placed under the current working directory. Use the "
-d
" option to specify a different directory.
You receive the following messages indicating that you have successfully generated the 
offline-download.zip
 file:
2022-10-12 10:22:00 INFO generate offline-download.zip from /home/centos/oo_chart/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.x/oo-helm-charts/charts/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.x.tgz
...
2022-10-12 10:23:40 INFO offline-download.zip is generated under <option specified at -d argument>
 
Now that you generated the 
offline-download.zip
, unzip it to have access to 
image-set.json
 which will you'll need in the
following steps:
Note
:
 If you have already uploaded images to your registry, skip this step.


Note
: In case of any issues, run the following script with -h argument to display the command line options for
the 
generate_download_bundle
 script:  
./generate_download_bundle.sh -h


Important
:
Make sure you have zip package installed on the Bastion host, otherwise 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 fails
with the bellow error:
[FATAL] 2022-08-11 17:16:11 : Command: "zip" not found. Please install "zip" tool first!
If your Bastion host runs CentOS 7, and you don't have 
zip
 package installed, use 
rpm
 to install it from
the CentOS official repository. 
Example: 
sudo rpm -ivh http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/zip-3.0-11.el7.x86_64.rpm
