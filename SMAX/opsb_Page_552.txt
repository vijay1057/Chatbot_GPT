Hardware requirements for option 3: SMA DND OO CGRO
If you plan to use deployment option 3 (SMA + DND + OO + CGRO), plan your hardware resources as follows. 
To set up OO with a common database, you can choose to connect OO to the same database instance as the rest of the suite
components. For hardware requirements, see the below table 
Standard hardware requirements with a common
database.
To deploy OO for a 5-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here
.
To deploy OO for a 20-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here

Note: 
To use the Cloud Management functionality, you need to enable the OO, DND, and CGRO capabilities.
The following table assumes that the OO, SMA, and DND capabilities have the same deployment size. If this isn't
the case, see 
Hardware requirements for other options
 instead.
