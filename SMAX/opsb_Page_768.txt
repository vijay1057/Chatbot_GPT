Download images (on-premises
To install an application, you will need to download the required installation images. You need to:
Generate an image download tool package
Run the download script inside the tool package to download the required installation images.
Generate the download bundle
The 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 compares the images listed in the 
image-set.json
 file with the images that already exist
in the specified image organization of the specified registry. It will only download the missing images.
1
. 
Log on to the first control plane node.
2
. 
Run the following command to change the directory. 
cd  ${CDF_HOME}/tools/generate-download
3
. 
Run the command together with the options required by your deployment. For example, run the following command
(running this command may take several minutes):
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart <audit helm chart file> -o <org name> [-d <destination dir>]
Where:
<audit helm chart file>
: The absolute path to the downloaded Audit helm chart package.
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, it's
hpeswitom
.
<destination dir>
: The directory where the output .zip file gets created. The default location is the current directory.
The 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 compares the images needed by the suite with the images that already exist in the
cluster and generates a .zip file, 
offline-download.zip
. This file enables you to download the required images from Docker
Hub.
For example:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart Audit_Helm_Chart-2022.11/audit-helm-charts/charts/audit-1.0.0+20221100.24.tgz -o hpeswitom -d /tmp
You can find the 
offline-download.zip
 under the current working directory unless you specify the "
-d
" option. You receive
the following messages indicating that you have successfully generated the 
offline-download.zip
 file:
[INFO] 2020-07-31 17:58:46 : ** Generating the offline image download bundle ...
[INFO] 2020-07-31 17:58:50 : Completed generation of offline-download.zip in /tmp
Download the required installation images
1
. 
Log on to the first control plane node. If the first control plane node can't access Docker Hub, transfer the  
offline-
download.zip
  file to a Linux server that can access Docker Hub.
2
. 
Extract the .zip package to a directory. If you can't access Docker Hub directly, set up the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. For
example, run the following commands to set the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Replace the placeholders with your actual server and
port. 
export http_proxy="<http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
export https_proxy="<https://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
3
. 
Go to the directory where you extracted the 
offline-download.zip
 package.
4
. 
Run the following command:
 
./downloadimages.sh [-r <image repository URL>] [-u <username>]  [-d <image download directory>] [-c on|off] [-o <org name>]
Where:
<image repository URL>
: Specify the 
-r
 option if you want to download the images from a repository other than Docker
Hub.
Replace 
<username>
 with the Docker Hub username. If you don't specify the credentials here, you will be prompted to
specify them when you run the command.
<image download directory>
: The directory where the container images get downloaded. The default value is
/var/opt/cdf/offline.
The 
-c
 option helps to verify the digital signature of the images during the download. The default setting is off, which
doesn't verify the signature.
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, this is 
hpeswitom
.
 This option is mandatory if you aren't using the default organization name.

 command, run the following command:
