Select the Integration user that is required for the OPB to use and then under the System use definitions assign the
appropriate rights to allow Incident creation. In this example Tenant Admin role has been assigned but if you need to limit the
permissions assigned IT User could be used.
Now create the Offering
From the Agent view within SMAX go to Service Catalogue. In here either use an existing Category or create a new one. For
this scenario, we’ll use the Business Application category with a Business Application of eExpense which has already been
defined. It is here that an Offering of Password Reset will be created.
Within Offerings Click New. Then enter in the relevant details about the Offering like shown below.
Next is to define the User Options. These are important as this is what will be passed from SMAX to OO for the flow to use to
reset the password. Information passed back from OO will be stored here also.
