Click 
Next
. The 
Connection
 page opens.
9
. 
Enter the external access hostname and port (443), which will be used to access the suite user interface.
10
. 
To use custom certificates, select 
Use custom certificates
. You get extra options to choose the certificate format. When
using custom certificates, you must import the Certification Authority(CA) certificates into the browser from where you will
log in to the management portal.
11
. 
Choose a certificate format.
If you choose the 
PKCS#1 or PKCS#8
 option:
a
. 
Select a 
CA certificate
 for a root certificate.
b
. 
Select a 
Server certificate
.
The supported certificate formats include: .crt, .cer, and .pem files.
c
. 
Select a key file. The supported private key formats include 
PKCS1
 and 
PKCS8
.
d
. 
Enter the private key password for the encrypted private key file.
The root certificate must be trusted and from the parent domain.
The server certificate, a certificate chain, must contain the origin server certificate (server.crt) and all
intermediate certificates. The root certificate/CA is optional for the server certificate.
The server certificate must be in the following sequence: the original server certificate, the intermediate
certificated, and the root certificate. Merge all the certificates into a certificate chain.
If you choose the 
PKCS#12
 option:
a
. 
Choose a CA .crt file for CA certificate.
b
. 
Select a .pfx file for the PKCS#12 file.
c
. 
Enter the PKCS#12 file password.
d
. 
Enter the private key password.
You can also update the certificates in the management portal after the installation.

Click 
Next
. The 
File Storage
 Page opens.
13
. 
On the 
File Storage
 page, a list of NFS volumes required for the OMT and suite installation appears. Before you proceed,
make sure the required NFS shares for OMT and the suite are already configured and the exported NFS folders are empty.
To configure the file storage, perform the following steps:
a
. 
Configure the first volume:
I
. 
Select 
Managed NFS
 
as 
File System Type
.
II
. 
Enter the DNS name of the created EFS. It's the 
FileServerDNSName
 you got on the 
Outputs
 tab when
creating the EFS stack (see the last step in 
Launch EFS
).
III
. 
Enter the Exported Paths of EFS volumes using the 
/<base directory>/<volume label on the web UI>
 format. For
example, if you provide the <base directory> as 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/
 and the current volume's display label
shows 
db-backup-vol
, the exported path should be 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/db-backup-vol
.
b
. 
Although you can repeat the steps above to manually configure the rest of the NFS volumes, we recommend using
the 
Auto-fill
 button if all of the NFS volumes that you have exported meet the following conditions:
are on the same NFS server
are located in the same parent folder (<base directory>)
follow the same exported path naming rule: <base directory>/<volume label on the web UI>
Once you have turned on the 
Auto-fill
 button, the installer automatically configures the remaining NFS volumes for
you as follows:
File System Type
: same as the file system type that you provided for the first volume.
File Server
: same as the NFS Server hostname or IP address that you provided for the first volume.
Exported Path
: the installer sets this field as 
/<base directory>/<volume label on the web UI>
. For example, if you
provide the <base directory> as 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/
 and the current volume's display label shows 
db-backup-vol
,
the installer automatically populates the exported path field with 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/db-backup-vol
.
c
. 
Click 
Next
. The system validates the volume configurations and then proceeds to the next screen if the validation
succeeds. If the validation fails, you need to reconfigure the volumes and then click 
Next
 again. Note that the
validation process may take a few minutes.
14
. 
A warning appears. Click 
Yes
 to continue the deployment.
After you click 
Yes
, you can't go back to the Select phase.
