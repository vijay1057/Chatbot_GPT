Prepare external database for Audit
To prepare PostgreSQL, perform the following tasks.
Install PostgreSQL
You must create a separate PostgreSQL database for Audit service. This database can share the same PostgreSQL instance as
SMAX. Make sure you enable SSL on the PostgreSQL because Audit uses SSL to communicate with PostgreSQL. Instructions on
how to create a user and a database for a service for PostgreSQL are provided in the 
PostgreSQL
 section below.
Configure PostgreSQL database server
If you are creating a separate PostgreSQL instance for Audit service, then follow these steps:
1
. 
Enable TLS connections for the database server.
Both SSL modes (
verify-full
 and 
verify-ca
) are supported. For details, see the PostgreSQL documentation
2
. 
Configure the 
postgresql.conf
 file
In the 
postgresql.conf
 file, configure the following parameters depending on your ITOM Audit deployment size (Small,
Medium, or Large).
Note that the default value of the 
listen_addresses
 parameter is "
localhost
", which means only localhost can connect to the
PostgreSQL instance. You need to set 
listen_addresses = '*'
 to allow remote connections.
The following table provides example database settings for your reference.

. 
Configure encoding and locale. Make sure that the PostgreSQL instance uses the following encoding and locale settings:
Encoding: UTF8
LC_COLLATE: en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE: en_US.UTF-8
PostgreSQL 
 Below are sample SQL commands for creating a user and a database for a service for PostgreSQL database:
1
. 
Log in to your database server with the administrator credentials.
psql -h <host> -p <port> -U <PostgreSQL admin>
2
. 
Run the following commands to create the database and the user used by the Audit Server:
CREATE USER <USERNAME> PASSWORD '<PASSWORD>';
CREATE DATABASE <DBNAME > OWNER <USERNAME>;
<PASSWORD>
 for the database user should be at least 16 characters long and have alphanumeric characters, at least
one lower case letter, at least one upper case letter, and at least one digit.
Note
It is strongly recommended to host the database server on a 
physical machine
, and it should be an
independent server without other applications running on it.
Also, if the database server machine is a virtual machine, the resource must be dedicated to the database
server.
Database servers must be set to the same time zone, daylight savings settings, and time as the Audit server.
The Audit server should be located in the same LAN as the database servers (without a proxy and firewalls
between them). Otherwise, your system's performance may be impacted.
