Link a license rule to a product
To have the license consumption calculated, set the product to use the correct license rule after creating the license. To do
this:
1
. 
Go to the 
Products 
> 
License rule settings
 tab, and then configure a default rule for the product version.
For your convenience, SAM also allows you to select a default license rule for all product versions. In this example, we use
the 
Licensing for desktop applications
 license rule.
Note:
 For the calculation to work correctly, the license metric of the license rule must be the same as that configured for
the license model.

First, entitle users who can use the license by following these steps. See 
Edit a license record
 for more information.
