To check the default gateway address on a node, run the following command on the node:
ip route | grep default
If your terminal resembles the following after you run the command, the default gateway address is already set:
default via 192.0.2.1 dev ens32  proto static  metric 100
If there is no return value, the default gateway isn't set on the node. Run the following command on the node to add a default
gateway:
route add default gw <IP address> <interface name>
For example, you run the following command:
route add default gw 192.0.2.24 eth0
