Once started, confirm that the agent has been configured correctly by bringing up the Service Management Automation X
Integration page and clicking on the agent just created. Confirm that the status is ‘Success’. If it did not connect successfully,
try restarting the agent. If restarting does not correct the issue, consult the controller log located in the 
C:\Program Files\Micro Foc
us\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\log\controller
 directory for more information on connection issues.
Adding the email integration credentials to the OPB
After installing the agent, you must add the email integration credentials to the OPB so that the agent can connect to the
Gmail account. This is done using the ‘Endpoint credentials manager’ of the OPB, available in the start menu.
