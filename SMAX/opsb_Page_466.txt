Workflow
This figure shows how to create compliance reports for analyzing your software license position using SAM.
Out of the box, SAM provides a number of license metrics and license rules, which are essential in compliance calculations.
This use case directly leverages an OOTB license metric and license rule to calculate license consumption. If your business
scenario is more complex and requires creating new license metrics and license rules, see the 
Advanced use 
section of this
topic.
In case if you don’t have the necessary data for demo for testing purposes, you can deploy the SAM sample data in your
environment planned to run SAM. See 
Deploy sample data
.
Preparation
Before calculating license compliance for a product, you need to synchronize the product family information from UCMDB to
learn about the products deployed in your environment.
By default, SAM synchronizes the product family at midnight every day. You can also manually start a synchronization task
following these steps:
1
. 
From the top menu, select 
Products
.
2
. 
Click 
Sync from CMS
 to synchronize the product family from UCMDB.
The time needed to complete the synchronization depends on how many installed software CIs are held in UCMDB.
3
. 
Click the notification icon 
 
in the upper-right corner to view the task status.
4
. 
If the task completes successfully, click 
 
to view the imported products.
Once the products currently available in UCMDB have been imported, they can be used within SAM to create license
models.
