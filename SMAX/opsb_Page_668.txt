The operating system's default 
nproc
 values are defined in an 
xx-nproc.conf
 file in the 
/etc/security/limits.d
 directory. For
example, it's 
/etc/security/limits.d/20-nproc.conf
 for CentOS 7 /RHEL 7. The soft 
nproc
 value defines the maximum
allowed number of processes for each non-root user of the operating system.
To update the default 
nproc
 values:
1
. 
Open the 
/etc/security/limits.d/xx-nproc.conf
 file in a text editor.
Note that the 
/etc/security/limits.d/
 directory may contain multiple 
xx-nproc.conf
 files, which are read in a certain
order. The file that's the last read takes precedence. For information about the order, see your operating system
documentation.
2
. 
Make sure that this file contains the same nproc values as in the 
/etc/security/limits.conf
 file. See the 
Increase OS
resource limits
 section for the recommended values.
Note
: The values defined in the 
/etc/security/limits.d/xx-nproc.conf
 file take precedence over those in the
/etc/security/limits.conf
 file. If the values are too small, there will be an insufficient number of processes allowed for
the user with a UID of <
SYSTEM_USER_ID
>. As a result, when you have many tenants and try to log in to one of them,
the login may fail with a "Static content unavailable" error.
Check the NFS version  (CentOS only)
If using a medium/large sizing profile and deploying your NFS service on CentOS and 
HDD
 (hard disk drive) storage, you need
to pay attention to your NFS version. Based on lab benchmark testing, inappropriate combinations of CentOS and NFS versions
have negative impact on the whole system's stability.
The following is a list of recommended combinations for better stability:
CentOS 7.5.1804 + nfs-utils (1.3.0, 0.54.el7)
CentOS 7.6.1810 + nfs-utils (1.3.0, 0.54.el7)
CentOS 7.6.1810 + nfs-utils (1.3.0, 0.65.el7)
For other combinations, to mitigate the impact, you need to extend your storage capability by adding more hard disk drive
space, or switch to SSD storage directly.
