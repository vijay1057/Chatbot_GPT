Live Support
The Live Support module is specifically created for the agents that will create requests coming in through the company’s
phone system. Live Support can connect directly to our Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) system so the agent can see the
caller’s name, related information, and recent requests without having to take any action. If we aren't using CTI, the agent
simply begins to type the caller’s name and the system will provide a list of possible matches in the system. Live Support can
also help the agent to determine the proper resolution of the request depending on the description they have entered. Live
Support will suggest:
Knowledge articles based on the request description
Recent incidents on the service specified in the request
Any known issues with the equipment (configuration items) that the caller has
Offerings that might relate to the request description
Knowledge articles that the agent has marked as their favorites
This functionality brings curated system knowledge from several areas and puts it in front of the agent automatically. This can
save the agent time and produce a better experience for the caller. The agent can resolve the request directly from Live
Support, or create a new request for processing by another agent or team.
Live Support brings a number of features directly to the agent. Details about the 
Live Support features
 can be found in the
online guide.
