Make sure the external database can accept the database connection from the OMT cluster. add the following lines to the 
pg_hba.conf
 file:
hostssl cdfapiserverdb cdfapiserver 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256
hostssl cdfapiserverdb <postgres admin> 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256
hostssl itom-cdf-idm cdfidm 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256
hostssl itom-cdf-idm <postgres admin> 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256
hostssl postgres <postgres admin> 172.0.0.0/24 scram-sha-256
Where:
hostssl
 is the network connection protocol. Better use 
hostssl
 rather than 
host
 as the protocol.
cdfapiserverdb
 is the database name.
cdfapiserver
 is the user name.
172.0.0.0/24 is the client machine's IPv4 address that's allowed to connect to the PostgreSQL server. To allow the
connection from OMT, replace 172.0.0.0/24  with the IPv4 address range of the cluster nodes or a single cluster
node's hostname.
scram-sha-256 is the authentication method.
itom-cdf-idm
 is the name of the OMT IdM database that the installer will automatically create during the installation. 
cdfidm
 is the owner of the 
itom-cdf-idm
 database. The installer will automatically create this user (which you mustn't
change to another name). 
<postgres admin>
 is a PostgreSQL admin user with the "Superuser" role, such as 
postgres
.

Prepare external PostgreSQL for SMA
The following table lists the suite components that require database configuration during the suite installation. The suite
supports PostgreSQL databases with or without TLS enabled.

SMA allows you to use a separate PostgreSQL instance for each component. The following steps assume that you are using
one PostgreSQL instance for all components:
1
. 
Make sure your PostgreSQL instance doesn't contain databases that have duplicate names of the suite databases.
During the suite installation, you will need to specify a database administrator (DBA) user for each component, and the
suite installer will automatically create the required databases and database owner for each component by using the DBA
account that you specify. See the following table for the names of the automatically created databases and users. If these
databases or users already exist, you need to delete them first; otherwise, your suite database configuration will fail when
you run the suite installer.

Later, during the installation, you will need to select the

 option, and enter 
itom-cdf-idm
 as the database name and the credentials
(name and password) of the database admin user (<postgres admin>).

Note
 After the suite installation, you can run the following command to obtain the randomly
generated password for the cdfidm user:
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get po -ncore |grep idm|head -1|awk '{print $1}') -ncore -cidm -- get_secret defaultdb_cdfidm_user_password|cut -c6-
