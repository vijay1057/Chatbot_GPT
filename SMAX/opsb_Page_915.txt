          - backend:
              service:
                name: "itom-ingress-controller-svc"
                port:

Replace the following with the actual values:
<cms_namespace>
: the unique namespace of the CMS deployment. For example, 
cms-prod
.
<application_loadbalancer_name>
: specify the name of the ALB to be created.
<cms_external_port>: The port number for external access. Use the port number that you set
in the 
global.externalAccessPort
 parameter in 
my-values.yaml
. For example, 
443
.
<certificate_arn>
: the
 resource name
 of the prepared certificate. For
example, 
arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
. See details in
the
 Prerequisites 
section above.
<external_access_host>
: the FQDN you've allocated for CMS. For example, 
www.example.com
.
<ingress_controller_port>
: The port number of the Ingress controller for the CMS deployment. Use the port number that
you set in the 
itom-ingress-controller.nginx.service.httpsPort
 parameter in your 
my-values.yaml 
file. For
example, 
30443
.
2
. 
Run the following command to apply the saved YAML file:
kubectl create -f cms-ingress.yaml
Now an ALB is created and the CMS Ingress for the external access port (for example, 443) is bound to this ALB automatically.
Add SMAX IP to the Inbound rule
You need to add the SMAX private IP to the Inbound rule in the security group that belongs to the CMS application load
balancer.
To do this, follow these steps:
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2
. 
Find the application load balancer automatically created for CMS.
3
. 
Click the security group for 
[k8s] Managed SecurityGroup for LoadBalancer
.
4
. 
Click 
Inbound rules
 > 
Edit inbound rules
, and then add the SMAX IP on the port (443, for example) used to access
SMAX in 
Source
.
Bind an FQDN with CMS ALB
After you create and configure the ALB for CMS, you need to bind the FQDN that you have allocated for CMS with this ALB.
See 
Bind an FQDN with Application Load Balancer
. 
Now you can access CMS with the following URLs. Note that at the moment you can only open these URLs. To log in to CMS as
suite-admin
, you must perform the 
Associate CMS SuperAdmin role
 task.
To access
Enter the following URL in your web browser
CMS landing page
https://<
EXTERNAL_ACCESS_HOST
>:<PORT>/cms
UCMDB Admin UI
https://<
EXTERNAL_ACCESS_HOST
>:<PORT>/ucmdb-ui
UCMDB JMX console
https://<
EXTERNAL_ACCESS_HOST
>:<PORT>/jmx-console
CMS UI
https://<
EXTERNAL_ACCESS_HOST
>:<PORT>/ucmdb-browser
Where, 
<
EXTERNAL_ACCESS_HOST
>
 is the one you bind with CMS ALB and 
<PORT>
 is the value that you specify for
the 
global.externalAccessPort
 parameter in 
my-values.yaml
.
Important 
 The name must consist of 
lower case
 alphanumeric characters, '-', or '.', and must start
and end with an alphanumeric character.
