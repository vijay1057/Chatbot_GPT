Transfer the images to the control plane node
If you downloaded the images to a server other than the first control plane node, transfer the images to a directory on the
first control plane node. By default, the images should be placed under the  
/var/opt/cdf/of
fline
 directory.
The images will be uploaded by the 
uploadimages.sh
 script later. The image upload requires up to 2 times the image size
space in the target image directory. For example, if you choose to use the default 
/var/opt/cdf/offline
 directory, ensure that
you have 2 times the OMT and suite image size space under 
/var/opt/cdf/offline
 directory of the control plane node.
