In multi-tenant (MT) environments, when you have two tabs for two different tenants opened in a
same browser and log in with the same shared service user, if you operate a request for tenant A
and then go to the other tab for tenant B, after you open a request of tenant B, the tenant ID in
the URL changes to tenant A and the

 error occurs. This issue is only fixed when you
open a link of tenant B in certain UI components. See
