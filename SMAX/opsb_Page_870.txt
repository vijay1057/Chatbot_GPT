Deploy the suite (FIPS mode)
At the 
Configure/Deploy
 phase, the installer starts to deploy the suite. Follow these steps to configure and deploy the suite.
1
. 
Accept the security agreement, and then click 
Next
.
Note
: Once you have accepted the agreement, a legal-agreement-YYYYMMDDHHMM.txt file is generated in the following
directory on the NFS server: <itom-vol-claim>/suite-install/itsma/output/. Here is an example: /var/vols/itom/core/suite-
install/itsma/output/legal-agreement-202007011403.txt.
2
. 
The 
Suite Installation Configuration
 page shows which capabilities will be installed and which deployment size will be
used. Click 
Next
. The 
Enable Auto Scaling
 toggle is turned off by default. Leave the toggle as is if the suite is deployed
on AWS.
3
. 
On the 
Configure Database 
page, switch on the 
External Database
 button to configure external databases for the
suite.
4
. 
Create a configuration for each external database server so that you can assign the configuration to one or more suite
components in the next step. To create database configurations, follow these steps:
a
. 
Click 
Add
 at the upper right corner of the screen.
b
. 
Specify a unique name (for example, suite-db1) for the database configuration and then click 
SAVE
.
c
. 
Specify the database connection settings.
Setting
Description
Example
PostgreSQL Server Host
Name or IP Address
Enter the fully-qualified domain name or IP address of the
external PostgreSQL database server.
sma-
pg.mycompany.net
PostgreSQL Server Port
Enter the communication port of the external PostgreSQL
database server.
5432
Username
 and 
Password
Enter the user name and password of the DBA user account
that you have already created. The suite will use the
PostgreSQL DBA accounts to create databases and database
owners for the suite components. The password must be at
least 14 bytes long. On the 
Suite Database Owner
Settings
 page, you need to specify an initial password for the
suite database owner.

TLS 1.2
If the PostgreSQL database server requires TLS connections,
perform the following steps:
1
. 
Select the 
TLS 1.2
 option.
2
. 
Upload your PostgreSQL CA certificate file (in PEM format)
to the suite. The CA certificate can be single-level or
multi-level. If multi-level, the CA certificate must include
the entire CA certificate chain (that is, the root CA
certificate, second CA certificate, and third CA
certificate). To upload the PostgreSQL CA certificate file,
either drag and drop the file from your local drive to the
box or browse to the file.
3
. 
Wait until the file upload is complete.
4
. 
Select an SSL mode from the list:
verify-ca
: the client will verify that the server is
trustworthy by checking the certificate chain up to a
trusted certificate authority (CA).
verify-full
: the client will also verify that the server
hostname matches the common name in the server
certificate. The SSL connection will fail if the server
certificate can't be verified. This mode is
recommended in most security-sensitive
environments.
Notes
:
By deselecting the 
TLS
 
1.2
 option, you are disabling or
bypassing security features, thereby exposing the system
to increased security risks. By using the non-TLS option,
you understand and agree to assume all associated risks
and hold 
Micro Focus
 harmless for the same.
You have the option to enable PostgreSQL SSL after the
installation. For details, see 
Enable SSL connections to
external PostgreSQL after suite installation

Click 
SAVE
.
e
. 
Repeat the steps above to create more database configurations if needed.
f
. 
Check that the screen displays a list of database configurations that you have created.
5
. 
For each suite component, select a database configuration from the list. When done, click 
Test
 to make sure that you can
connect to the databases.
Note that if you specify an unsupported database, the database connection test will not pass. After the test passes, click
NEXT
.
6
. 
For each suite component, the suite installer will automatically create one or more databases and one database owner on
the specified external PostgreSQL database server. The installer creates each database in a private schema. The
following table lists these automatically created databases and database owners.
On the 
Suite Database Owner Settings
 page, you need to specify an initial password for the suite database owner.
