The syntax to add this through the REST API can be seen in the example below.  The name is the type of relationship that is to
be added, in this example we are making a Request depend on an Incident so we use "IncidentCausedByRequest" as the type. 
We enter Incident and the Incident Id as the firstEndpoint.  The secondEndpoint is the Request and the Request Id and in the
case we are creating the relationship so the operation is CREATE.
Adding a user to a group is another common operation run through the REST API. To add 2 users to the "Administrative
Services" we would create a PersonToGroup relationship and make the firstEndpoint the Person and their Id.  The
secondEndpoint is the Id of the group.  In this example two users are added to the group, notice the Id for the Person changes
but the Id group stays the same:
