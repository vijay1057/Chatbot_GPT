CMS configuration prerequisites
This section describes a prerequisite step that you must perform within CMS if you have Native SACM enabled. The purpose of
this step is to avoid issues with Business Service CI uniqueness because it’s possible to create services with the same name as
IaC Gateway. This step requires the use of the UCMDB Local Client to interact with UCMDB. See 
How to install the Local Client
.
To deactivate the service name uniqueness constraint, do the following:
1
. 
Log in to the UCMDB UI using the Local Client or through the browser.
2
. 
Navigate to the 
CI Type Manager
 and make sure you are in the CI Types view.
3
. 
Navigate the tree structure to find 
Business Service CI
.
4
. 
Double click to get Details and in the Identification section choose “
No Identification
”.
5
. 
Save and exit.
Optional step: enable cost estimation for Terraform Plan
IaC Gateway supports the optional ability to estimate the cost of an input Terraform state. This calculation uses a third-party
service called
 
Infracost, and supports native AWS, Azure, and GCP resources provisioned through Terraform.
Below are the steps to enable Infracost cost estimation on a tenant within IaC Gateway and allow it to be propagated into ESM.
Install Infracost
Install Infracost, register, and set up an API Key to get access. For details, see
 Install Infracost
.
Set up integration between IaC Gateway and Infracost
Note 
This value will show up after the first instantiation of the Terraform state file being stored in ESM.
