Service Category
The service category is a high-level definition that groups similar services. For example, since we have services for Lync, online
conference rooms, and internal discussion forums, we might create a service category for 'Meeting and Collaboration' and put
all of those services inside of it.
The primary use of service categories is to help the end user find what they are looking for, so we should create our definitions
with that in mind. As you see here, the first thing the end user experiences in the Service Management Automation Service
Portal is a list of categories they can choose from.
The other thing you will notice is that we can make some significant changes to the way SMAX presents our catalog to the end
user. We can change both the background and icon of each category and determine the order to display the categories.
Another thing we can do that you can’t see is to limit certain categories to specific groups and/or locations using the
entitlement rules I mentioned earlier. We can create an entitlement rule for a specific group, role, and/or location, and then set
that rule in a category’s 'Audience' section. Only end users that meet the criteria of the entitlement rule (having the right
location for example) will see the category in the Service Management Automation Service Portal.
Service Definition
The service definition level is made up of the service definitions that we created earlier. In order for a service to show up in our
service catalog, we need to fill in the catalog description and category in the service definition.
Just like our service categories, we can specify the ‘Audience’ of the service definition based on entitlement rules. This can
control who can request the service or any of its related offerings.
