Service Design
Designs are the recipes for automating the cloud and include reusable service components. Service components and their
relationships in a design define the framework for creating the service. Create, configure, and change service designs to give
on-demand, automated service delivery.
Designs also offer a structure for options that consumers can select when ordering service. You can re-use designs for multiple
service offerings, with each service offering customized to meet the needs of different consumer organizations and groups.
