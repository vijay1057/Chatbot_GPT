The PG Password Reset flow that was created earlier within OO should be returned. On the right-hand side, the mandatory
fields are shown which should match up to the User Options that were created earlier. Click OK to add this flow.
The next part that must be entered are the flow parameters. This is how SMAX knows what fields to map across to OO.
Rather than just type in the relevant values of what should be supplied, functions need to be used as some data needs
supplying by the end user. There is other information which will not be supplied by the end user but will be set by the agent as
a default value. Make sure you click on the fx button, it is then highlighted blue and then entity the function.
The Table below shows the values entered above for each field
Field Name
Value
DBServerName
${entity.UserOptions.DBServerName_c}
DBType
${entity.UserOptions.DBType_c}
DBPort
${entity.UserOptions.DBPort_c}
Database
${entity.UserOptions.Database_c}
userPassword
${entity.UserOptions.NewPassword_c}
SMAXLoginURL
${entity.UserOptions.SMAXLoginUrl_c}
smaxIncidentModelID
${entity.UserOptions.SmaxIncidentModelID_c}
smaxTenantID
${entity.UserOptions.SmaxTenantID_c}
Once all values have been entered, click 
OK
.
Next, enter the Output fields using Add user Option.
