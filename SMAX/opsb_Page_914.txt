Configure load balancers for CMS
To access CMS, you need to create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and configure the listener for CMS on this ALB.
Prerequisites
Before creating and configuring an ALB, allocate an FQDN for CMS (for example, via 
AWS route 53 services
) if you don't have
one. You also need to prepare a new certificate using one of the following methods. Or else, unexpected errors might occur at
later steps.
Request a certificate
If you want to request a new certificate, follow these steps:
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console in your target region.
2
. 
Navigate to 
All services
 > 
Security, Identity, & Compliance
 > 
Certificate Manager
3
. 
If the "firstrun" page is displayed, click 
Get Started
.
4
. 
Click 
Request a certificate
.
5
. 
Select 
Request a public certificate
 and click 
Request a certificate
.
6
. 
Specify your target domain name. Use an asterisk (*) to request a wildcard certificate to protect several sites in the same
domain. For example, 
*.testcms-ng.org .
7
. 
Click 
Next
.
8
. 
Select 
DNS validation
 or 
Email validation
 according to your permission.
9
. 
Click 
Review
 and then click 
Confirm and request
.
10
. 
Click 
Continue
.
11
. 
Finish the certificate validation based on the method you just selected. For more information,
see 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/acm/validation
.
Import a certificate
If you want to use a customized certificate, follow these steps:
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console in your target region.
2
. 
Navigate to 
All services
 > 
Security, Identity, & Compliance
 > 
Certificate Manager
3
. 
If the "firstrun" page is displayed, click 
Get Started
.
4
. 
Click 
Import a certificate
.
5
. 
For 
Certificate body
, paste the PEM-encoded certificate to import.
6
. 
For 
Certificate private key
, paste the PEM-encoded, unencrypted private key that matches the certificate's public key.
7
. 
(Optional) For 
Certificate chain
, paste the PEM-encoded certificate chain.
8
. 
Click 
Next > Review and import > Import.
Create an Ingress for CMS
You need to create an Ingress for CMS with an external access port such as 443:
1
. 
Save the content below as 
cms-ingress.yaml
:
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: "cms-ingress"
  namespace: <cms_namespace>
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: <application_loadbalancer_name>
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTPS": <cms_external_port>}]'
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-protocol: HTTPS
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-port: traffic-port
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /cms
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/success-codes: 200-399
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: instance
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes: idle_timeout.timeout_seconds=180
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: <certificate_arn>
  labels:
    app: cms-ingress
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <external_access_host>
  rules:
    - host:
      http:
        paths:
Important 
Currently, services integrated with AWS Certificate Manager support only the 
RSA_1024
 and 
RS
A_2048
 algorithms.
