Create external databases
When deployed on Azure, the suite uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server as the database engine. This flexible
server instance is a fully managed database server for the OMT IdM, OMT API Server, and the suite in a production
environment.
OMT uses two databases:
One for the OMT IdM. This database is normally referred to as the "OMT database." You will need to configure this
database later in the installation portal (see 
Select the deployment configuration
).
One for the OMT API Server. You will need to specify this database when deploying the bootstrap (see 
Deploy bootstrap
). 
When specifying a password for the OMT IDM database user, make sure that the password meets the following requirements:
Contains 10-16 characters
Contains at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
Contains at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
Contains at least one of these special characters: 
,\:/. _?&%=+-[]()
Contains at least one digit (0-9)
Set up an Azure flexible server
To set up an Azure flexible server, follow these steps.
1
. 
Go to the Azure portal (
https://portal.azure.com
).
2
. 
Search for "Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible servers" and open it.
3
. 
Click 
Create
.
4
. 
On the creation page, enter the following information.
Project details
Subscriptions
: Enter your subscription ID. You can get it from the 
Azure portal Home
page
 > 
Subscriptions
.
Resource group
: Enter the name of the resource group created in the prerequisite tasks (see 
Build an AKS
cluster
). For example, myResourceGroup.
Server details
Server name
: Enter a name for the flexible server. For example: 
mypghost
.
Region
: Choose a region. Ideally, your database should be in the same region as your production environment.
Workload type:
 Select a workload type according to your needs.
Compute + storage
: Click 
Configure server
, then choose the compute size according to the 
Sizing
considerations for Azure deployment
. Click 
Save
.
Availability Zone
: Select a value as needed. See the Azure documentation for instructions. 
High availability
  
Check 
Enable high availability
 as needed. Selecting this option will enable zone redundant high availability
across availability zones.
PostgreSQL Version
: Choose the PostgreSQL version. For details about supported PostgreSQL versions, see
Support matrix for Azure deployment
.
Administrator account
Admin username
: Name your database administrator. 
Password
: Set the password for the admin.
Confirm password
: Confirm the password.
5
. 
Click 
Next: Networking
. Enter the following information.
Connectivity method
: Select 
Private access(Vnet Integration) 
>
 Virtual network
.
Subscription: 
Enter your subscription ID. You can get it from the 
Azure portal Home page
 > 
Subscriptions
.
Virtual network:
 Select the Vnet you created for the SMA production environment.
Subnet:
 Select the subnet prepared for 
PostgreSQL
.

. 
Click 
Review + create
.
7
. 
Download the root CA. To do this, go to the 
Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server
 page, click the
Networking
 section, then click 
Download SSL Certificate
.
You will need to select the 
Use TLS connection
 option and upload this certificate in the IdM database configuration step
during the installation.
8
. 
Check and validate if the database is ready. First, install the PostgreSQL client on the bastion if you haven't done so by
running the following commands.
sudo yum install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
#Specify the postgresql version. 
sudo yum install -y postgresql<
PostgreSQL_Version
>.x86_64 
Where: 
<PostgreSQL_Version>
 is the postgresql version. It should be the same as the PG server. 
Important:
 This release no longer supports the method of installing PostgreSQL on a virtual machine on
Azure. For an existing installation with self-hosted PostgreSQL on an Azure virtual machine, you must 
Migrate
from self-hosted PostgreSQL to Azure Flexible Server
