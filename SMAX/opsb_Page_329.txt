From here, click on 
Users
 so the integration user can be linked to this tenant.
Click on 
Attach 
and then choose your Integration user.
Click 
Attach 
and then 
Save
.
Now within the Tenant this user will need to be synced. In order to do this, log in with a Tenant Admin user. From the Main
Menu, click on 
Administration
 and then 
People
.
Click on 
Sync
 if the new Integration User is not listed.
Once the Integration user appears within the tenant, assign the appropriate rights.
Open the Integration user and scroll down to the section 
System use definitions
. At present only the Self-Service Portal
User will exist. Type 'OPB ' and you should see the role 
OPB Remote Agent
. Click on this to add the role. Do the same
for 
Tenant Admin Role
 if required. In the following example, either Tenant Admin or IT User can be used. If you want to limit
the permissions that the Integration user can use, do not assign the Tenant Admin role.
