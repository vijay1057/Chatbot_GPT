(Optional) Install Operations Orchestration Containerized
Operations Orchestration (OO) embedded in Design and Deploy (DND) has been removed. You must migrate from OO
embedded in DND to OO Containerized before you can use the DND capability. 
OO Containerized is a capability that enables seamless automation and orchestration of repeatable IT operations across
teams, tools, and environments. On installing OO Containerized, you will get OO Central with an Internal OO Remote Action
Service (RAS). The internal OO RAS is deployed automatically for each OO Central tenant in a tight coupling framework during
the tenant deployment process. 
Additionally, you can install the following components depending on your requirement.
External RAS
 - To achieve high availability of RASes, you can install an external RAS apart from the internal RAS that is
available on installation OO Containerized. 
OO Workflow Designer
 - OO Workflow Designer is a web-based environment for authoring flows, which is available as a
standalone product that can be deployed either on a Windows or Linux server. Flows are authored in the CloudSlang
language and run in OO Central. 
You can run a script so that the OPB download center in the SMAX UI displays direct download links for OO RAS and OO
Workflow Designer. See 
Enable direct download of OO RAS and OO Workflow Designer from the SMAX UI
.
For more information, see 
Install external RAS
 and 
Install Workflow Designer
. 
Together, the components of OO enable you to manage various services and devices across the organization and across their
life cycle.
