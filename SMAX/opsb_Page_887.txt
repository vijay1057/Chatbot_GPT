Launch RDS for CMS
CMS contains an internal (embedded) PostgreSQL database instance, which should be used for demonstration purposes only.
You must use external databases in a production environment. 
When deployed on AWS, the suite uses RDS as the database engine. This RDS instance will be used as the external databases
for the following CMS components:
UCMDB Server
AutoPass License Service (APLS)
Prepare RDS template for CMS
1
. 
Navigate to the
 smax-rds.template
 file under 
../Cloud Deployment x.x.x/byok/smax-cloudformation-aws
 in 
the cloud
deployment package
.
2
. 
Create a copy of the
 smax-rds.template
 file and rename the new file to
 cms-rds.template
.
3
. 
Replace the
 
two
 SMAX-RDS-Security-Group 
keys (under 
RDSSecurityGroup
 
in 
cms-rds.template
) with 
CMS-
RDS-Security-Group
, and then save the file.
Create an RDS instance for CMS
We recommend that you use RDS as the database engine on AWS. Follow these steps to launch RDS for CMS.
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console and switch to the selected region.
2
. 
Go to 
All services
 > 
Management & Governance 
>
 CloudFormation
.
3
. 
Click
 Create stack
, click 
Template is ready
 > 
Upload a template file
 > Choose file and select the 
cms-
rds.template
 file under 
../Cloud Deployment x.x.x/byok/smax-cloudformation-aws
.
4
. 
Click 
Next 
and populate the following fields:
Stack name
: Give a name to this stack, such as 
cms-rds
.
VPC ID
: Select the created VPC from the drop-down list.
First/Second Subnet for RDS
: Select the first/second database subnet created for RDS.
RDS Instance Type
: Select an instance type from the drop-down list. See 
Sizing considerations for EKS deployment
.
RDS instance identifier
: Define an RDS instance name.
User name
: Type a username for the database admin account, such as "postgres."
Password
: Define a password for the database admin account.
RDS Storage size
: Type a storage size. See 
Sizing considerations for EKS deployment
.
Postgres engine version
: Type an engine version. See 
Support matrix
.
Multi-AZ RDS
: Select false for test and development environments, select true for staging and production
environments
BastionSecurityGroup
: Select the bastion's security group to allow the bastion node to communicate with RDS.
ClusterSecurityGroup
: Select the EKS cluster's security group (
eks-cluster-sg-*
) to allow the EKS cluster to
communicate with RDS.

. 
Click 
Next > Next > Create stack
. Wait until the stack creation finishes and you can check the results under
the 
Outputs 
tab. Take a note of the value of 'RDSEndpointAddress'. It will be used in later steps.
After the RDS is created, you must test its connectivity by running the commands below on the bastion node. 
sudo yum install -y postgresql
psql -h <RDSEndpointAddress> -U <postgres admin> -d postgres
Where: 
<RDSEndpointAddress>
 
can be collected in the 
Outputs 
of the previous step.
<postgres admin>
 is the PostgreSQL admin user you specified when launching RDS. Replace it with the actual value.
Next, set up the PostgreSQL databases for CMS on the RDS instance created.
Set up PostgreSQL databases for CMS on the RDS instance
In a production environment, you must use external databases for the CMS application. The database user and database name
information are required when you install CMS, and the database schema information is required for UCMDB Server, but
optional for AutoPass. The default schema name will be used if there is no new schema name assigned.
The databases must be empty so that CMS will initialize them during installation. The table below shows example database
information prepared for the four components.
Service
DB User
DB Name
Schema (default)
UCMDB Server
cms_ucmdb
cms_ucmdb_db
ucmdb
APLS
cms_autopass
cms_autopass_db
public
Below are sample SQL commands for creating a user and a database for a service:
1
. 
Log in to the bastion node and then run the following command to connect to the PostgreSQL instance.
psql -h <RDSEndpointAddress> -p <RDSEndpointPort> -U <postgres admin> -d postgres
