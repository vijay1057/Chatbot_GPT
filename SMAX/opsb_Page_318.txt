Adding a User
Adding a user is very similar to adding a contact. However, as discussed in the import person document, users also get an
account created in the SMA Suite Administration portal so that they can login to Service Management Automation X. To create
a user that can login to Service Management Automation X, add all the required attributes but do not include the 
IsMaasUser
field. If a record with the same unique identifier (UPN) exists, Service Management Automation X updates the record. If a
contact exists then it is converted into a user. If no record exists, a new user record is added.
{
 "operation": "CREATE_OR_UPDATE",
 "users": [{
  "properties": {
   "Upn": "MyNewUser@microfocus.com",
   "upnDataType":"Customer_UID", #(only if custom Upn and not Email)
   "Email":"MyNewUser@microfocus.com",
   "FirstName":"My First Name",
   "LastName":"My Last Name",
   "Location":"London", 
   "OfficePhoneNumber":"867-5309",
   "EmployeeNumber": "4815162342"
  }
 }]
}
Updating a User
Similar to updating contacts, the UPN field is used to search for an existing user. If one is found that record is updated,
otherwise a new record is added. Using the body shown below would update the phone number of a user in Service
Management Automation X and also in the Service Management Automation Portal.
{
 "operation": "CREATE_OR_UPDATE",
 "users": [{
  "properties": {
   "Upn": MyNewUser@microfocus.com,
   "upnDataType":"Customer_UID", #(only if custom Upn)
   "EmployeeNumber": "4456234"
  }
 }]
}
Adding Groups to Users
The Manage Person API provides a way to update the groups that users belong to. Adding an additional parameter to the JSON
payload allows groups to be added, replaced or removed. The group can be added when users are created or when they are
updated. The syntax below would add a group to an existing user. The Manage Person API uses the group’s UPN when adding a
person to it. If one of the groups is an organizational group then the users organization will be automatically set.
{
 "operation": "CREATE_OR_UPDATE",
 "users": [{
  "properties": {
   "Upn": "MyNewUser@microfocus.com"
  },
  "groups":{"ADD":["CAB_Group","Problem_Manager_Group"]} 
 }]
}
Using the Postman client, adding groups to a user would look like:
