Uninstall OO on AWS
To uninstall Operations Orchestration (OO) on AWS with EKS, perform the following tasks:
Delete the OO deployment
1
. 
Log on to the bastion node, and navigate to the OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) installation directory:
cd OMT_External_K8s_2022.xx.xxxxx/bin
2
. 
Run the following command to remove the OO release:
./helm uninstall <
OO RELEASE NAME
> -n <
OO NAMESPACE
>
Where:
<
OO RELEASE NAME
>
 is the OO release that you want to uninstall, which you can get by running the command 
./helm lis
t -n <

>.
<
OO NAMESPACE

. 
Run the following command to remove the OO deployment:
cd OMT_External_K8s_2022.xx.xxxxx/scripts
./cdfctl.sh deployment delete -d <
OO DEPLOYMENT NAME
>
Where
<
OO DEPLOYMENT NAME
>
 is the name you specified for the deployment you created to install OO.

Remove persistent volume and claims
If you created the 
oo-pv.yaml
 sample file as documented in the 
Prepare persistent volumes and claims for OO
 step, run the
following command to delete the persistent volumes:
kubectl delete -f <oo-pvc.yaml path>
kubectl delete -f <oo-pv.yaml path>
For example:
kubectl delete -f oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx/oo-helm-charts/samples/persistent_storage/oo-pvc.yaml
kubectl delete -f oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx/oo-helm-charts/samples/persistent_storage/oo-pv.yaml
Clean the Amazon Elastic File System volumes
1
. 
Copy and save the following script as 
cleanOONFS.sh
 on the bastion node:
#!/bin/bash
shopt -s extglob
# Edit as needed
MOUNT_POINT="/mnt/oo"
NFS_PARENT="var/vols/itom/oo"
rm -rf ${MOUNT_POINT}/${NFS_PARENT}/*/*
ls -l ${MOUNT_POINT}/${NFS_PARENT}/*/
2
. 
Run the following commands to clean up OO data in the NFS storage:
chmod 755 cleanOONFS.sh
sudo ./cleanOONFS.sh
Clean the databases
When you uninstall OO, the databases residing in the external PostgreSQL databases aren't removed. You need to remove the
databases manually.
Note
: If you have used different names when creating the databases and database users for OO components,
replace the default names below with the actual names you used.
