The decoration is stored on a container called “pause”, using the image gcr.io/google_containers/pause-amd64:3.1 (different
OMT releases may use a newer or different image). These containers are only visible when using host native commands such
as ctr or ps.

Kubernetes clusters are closed from a network perspective. All intra-container traffic stays inside the cluster. No outside
access to any internal cluster services is possible. All Ingress has to be declared explicitly: traffic from outside the cluster is
only possible if explicitly allowed.
Cross-node traffic is secured using TLS.
Pods and Services
Pods in Kubernetes are ephemeral. They can be created and destroyed dynamically. When destroyed, they won't have the
same network identify.
For this reason, Services were defined as a logical group of Pods. Services are long lived. Services load balance incoming
traffic across the set of Pods that they group.
A service represents a micro-service, such as a web server or a database engine. Services can be discovered using
environment variables (every container gets injected with all of the services in its namespace) or DNS (services are named get
a fixed long-lived DNS name and can be addressed this way).
Inside the cluster containers can talk to micro-services exposed via Services without having to know where the service runs,
how many replicas serve it or what its IP address is.
Cluster services receive IP address from the cluster service IP range. This is preset to 172.17.17.0/24. All cluster services will
receive an IP address allocated in this range. (This range is a configuration parameter to the Kubernetes API server, see
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-apiserver/
, --service-cluster-ip-range parameter.
Ingress / egress
Ingress
To access a service from an external network requires adding some additional information to expose it via a port on all nodes
or via a load balancer.
On OMT embedded Kubernetes, the services are of type clusterIP so by default they aren't visible from outside the cluster.
They may or may not be grouped under an Ingress controller to provide a unified URL namespace and access to the cluster
services.
A OMT AppHub plus an ITOM suite installation registers many services:

There are services for ultimately externally-facing services, and services that will never be exposed.
By default, none of the services are exposed externally. The default Kubernetes service type is ClusterIP which keeps the
services externally invisible but internally fully visible.
To allow external access for OMT AppHub services, an Ingress definition processed by an Ingress controller is needed or
