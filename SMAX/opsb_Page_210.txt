Change Flows
Change Workflow
Change management has three separate workflows we will examine. Each corresponds to a different type of change request:
Normal change - a change that will proceed through all steps of the change management process, and should be
reviewed by the Change Advisory Board (CAB).
Standard - a pre-approved change, an often repeated type of change that's low risk and has a well-understood plan.
Emergency - an urgent change that needs to be evaluated and approved (or rejected) in a very short time frame.
Sometimes an emergency change has to be opened in the system after the physical change has taken place.
While each type of change has a different workflow, they all go through the same steps. The differences come in which phases
the change goes through in each step.
Normal Change Workflow
The normal change workflow is the most common of new change requests. These changes must have an approved
implementation plan and an approved deployment plan. Let’s take a look at each step in the process.
Classification
When creating a change, the agent must supply the details for the request. This includes filling out the following fields during
the 'Log' phase:
Title - A short description of the change
Reason for change - Why the change is being made (from a list of defined choices)
Change Flows
Change management has three distinct workflows that may be used, depending on the change being performed.
Service Management Automation X provides some additional features that assist in scheduling changes and
improving the overall change management process over time.
