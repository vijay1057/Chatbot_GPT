customization needed when using Gmail, as it uses the default ports. If using a different email server with non-default ports,
the values on this form may need modification.
Only authorized email addresses can create requests in Service Management Automation X using the email integration. If the
domain of the sending email address is not in the authorized domain list, the email will not be accepted. The same is true for
email accounts that do not belong to a valid user in Service Management Automation X. Even when the domain is added to the
authorized domain, the email address must be associated to a valid user for a request to be created. You must add any
domains that will be sending emails to the authorized domains.
The actions Service Management Automation X will take when emails arrive in the Gmail inbox is defined in the configuration
section. If the ‘New email action’ is set to ‘Create Request’, then a new request will be created.
The inbox polling time is by default one minute but can be increased to any desired frequency. By default, the two Gmail
folders created earlier are assumed to be named ‘Processed’ and ‘Errors’. If different folder names are desired, they may be
defined here.
It is possible to set a default offering on this form for all requests submitted through the email integration. If this dropdown is
left blank, then no offering will be applied. However, the default can be assigned by selecting a value from the list. 
Enable the ability for users to create requests and other actions using email in the feature settings configuration. If contacts
need the ability to add requests, an agent must be assigned in the Email integration agent selection. The agent will appear as
the Requested By value in the requests.
