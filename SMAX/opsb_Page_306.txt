Sending and receiving the login token
To run a REST call on a SMAX tenant, an LWSSO_Cookie_Key must be provided.  To obtain this key requires users to first run a
REST call that authorizes the session.
Select the POST option and then add the URL and the tenant ID. For example: “
https://<HOSTNAME>/auth/authentication-
endpoint/authenticate/token?TENANTID=484980393”
Set the Authorization to “
No Auth”
In the Headers section, set the Content-Type to “
application/json
”.
Select raw for the Body type and then add the user that will be used to authenticate. The content must be in json format. For
example: 
“
{
"Login"
:
"A-login"
,
"Password"
:
"ThePassword"
}”
Click on the send button and a large string of characters will be returned from the authentication service.
