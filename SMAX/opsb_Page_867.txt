If you selected the CGRO capability while configuring the deployment options, specify the Vertica database connection
settings.
Setting
Description
Vertica
Hostname
or comma
separated
Hosts
 
Enter the fully-qualified domain name or IP address of the external Vertica database server.
Vertica
DB Name
Enter the database name of the external Vertica database server.
Vertica
DB Port
Name
Enter the communications port of the external Vertica database server.
Vertica
DB User
Name and
Password
Enter the user name and password of the DBA user account that you have already created. The suite
will use the Vertica DBA accounts to create databases and database owners for the suite components.
TLS 1.2
If the Vertica database server requires TLS connections, perform the following steps:
1
. 
Select the 
TLS 1.2 
option.
2
. 
Upload your Vertica CA certificate file (in PEM format) to the suite. The CA certificate can be
single-level or multi-level. If multi-level, the CA certificate must include the entire CA certificate
chain (that is, the root CA certificate, second CA certificate, and third CA certificate). To upload
the Vertica CA certificate file, either drag and drop the file from your local drive to the box or
browse to the file.
3
. 
Wait until the file upload is complete.
4
. 
Select an SSL mode from the list:
verify-ca
: the client will verify that the server is trustworthy by checking the certificate
chain up to a trusted certificate authority (CA).
verify-full
: the client will also verify that the server hostname matches the common name
in the server certificate. The SSL connection will fail if the server certificate can't be verified.
This mode is recommended in most security-sensitive environments.
Notes
:
If you don't select the 
TLS 1.2
 option and have configured the Vertica database with SSL, the
suite installation will go through but the CGRO functionality may not work.
By deselecting the 
TLS 1.2
 option, you are disabling or bypassing security features, thereby
exposing the system to increased security risks. By using the non-TLS option, you understand and
agree to assume all associated risks and hold 
OpenText
 harmless for the same.
Click 'Test' to validate the connection details. Based on the test result, you will see a corresponding message.

On the 
Suite Admin Settings
 page, specify an initial password for the following users, and click 
Next
:
suite-admin
: the user account used to access the Suite Administration interface.
bo-integration@dummy.com
: This is an internal integration user of the suite system. This user is used for internal
integration, such as for synchronizing data between tenants and the suite administration interface (which is named
"Suite Administration").
Note   
All these passwords must contain 10 to 16 characters from all the following categories:
At least one uppercase letter
At least one lowercase letter
At least one digit
