Resource providers
Deployment resource providers are management platforms that offer centralized control over the infrastructure and resources
used in a cloud computing environment. For example, a provider such as VMware vCenter can deploy virtual machines, while a
provider such as 
Micro Focus
 SiteScope can monitor applications.
A provider corresponds to a specific instance of an application that can be used to provision service designs. For example, to
provision service designs that target VMware vCenter, you must first create a provider (with a provider type of VMware
vCenter).
