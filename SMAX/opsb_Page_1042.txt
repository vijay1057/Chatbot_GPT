 Note   
If you use the 
Azure Files & Azure Disks
 solution, the system will automatically create all the
PVCs with StatefulSets replicas set to the maximum value. You can delete the unused PVs, PVCs, and Azure
disks to save costs. For example, for StatefulSet 
smarta-saw-con
 with 
1
 replicas, you can keep the PV, PVC,
and Azure disk only for 
smarta-saw-con-0
 and delete the ones for pods: 
smarta-saw-con-1/2/3/4/5
