Once saved the new Publisher is added to the list on the left hand. In the right hand screen the details of the newly added
metric can be seen. Now the new metric can be used with any License Rules which require this algorithm to work out usage.
License Rules – OOTB or Bespoke
In the current version of SAM there are 20 Software License rules which come OOTB. There are 4 Generic rules, 14 Microsoft
rules and 2 Oracle rules. In time more rules will be generated and published with later releases of SAM. If new rules are
required then Agents can either create new or clone existing rules depending upon their requirements. In most cases for the
majority of vendors the OOTB rules should be sufficient. In the worked example the Generic per Device rule will be used, so
the agent can go to the next stage in the process if they want to carry on following this example.
If the Agent requires an understanding of how to create a new rule or clone one then this is described below, but the process
won’t be used in the worked example showing the creation of a License Model, License and how the products then consume
the model.
