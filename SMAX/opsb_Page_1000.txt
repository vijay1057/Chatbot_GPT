Additional hardware requirements for CMS
Native SACM and SAM require you to install CMS (UCMDB Server and CMS Gateway). You have two options:
Classic CMS + Classic CMS Gateway
Containerized CMS (which comes with the UCMDB Server and CMS Gateway)
See 
here
 for the supported CMS versions in this release.
Plan additional hardware resources for CMS: 
If you plan to use classic CMS, install CMS Gateway on the UCMDB Server, and add the following minimal resources for CMS
Gateway (for classic CMS hardware resource requirements, see 
Classic CMS sizing recommendations
):
Deployment
CPU
RAM
Disk Space
All sizes
4 cores
2 GB (allocated for CMS Gateway only)
100 GB
If you plan to install the containerized CMS (as the next deployment on the same OMT), use the following guidelines to
determine the additional hardware resources required for CMS.
1. Determine the deployment size
When installing CMS, you will need to select a deployment size: Small, Medium, or Large, so that the CMS deployment is
automatically scaled according to the selected size. Use the following table to determine your deployment size.
Deployment size 
Small
Medium
Large
Maximum number of CIs and Relationships in CMDB
10 million
30 million
200 million
2. Determine the hardware resource requirements
The following table lists the minimum resources needed for setting up a CMS environment in the cloud.
A standard deployment includes control plane nodes (owned by Azure), worker nodes, Azure Files as storage, and PostgreSQL
as databases.
Note
: For Vertica HA configuration, follow the recommendations provided in vendor-specific documentation.
