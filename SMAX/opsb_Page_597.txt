Recommended Storage Format Types
Choose the storage format type based on deployment requirements. Vertica recommends the following storage format types
where applicable:
ext3
ext4
NFS for backup
XFS
Amazon S3 Standard for communal storage and related backup tasks when running in Eon Mode
For the Vertica I/O profile, the ext4 file system is considerably faster than ext3. The storage format type at your backup and
temporary directory locations must support fcntl lockf (POSIX) file locking.
