Configure NFS shares if using managed NFS storage
Perform the following steps on a control plane node, according to whether the NFS storage is using root_squash or
no_root_squash.
If using root_squash
1
. 
Log in to the control plane node.
2
. 
Perform steps 5 through 8 described in the 
Configure NFS shares for self-hosted NFS storage
 section.
If using no_root_squash
1
. 
Log in to the control plane node.
2
. 
Perform steps 5 through 8 for self-hosted NFS storage (including creating the NFS directories, changing the permission of
the directories, adding a UID and GID, and changing the ownership of the directories). 
3
. 
Run the 
chmod -R g+s
 command.
If you are using the same base directory for all NFS volumes, run the 
chmod -R g+s <base directory>
 command. For
example:
chmod -R g+s /var/vols/itom
Alternatively, repeat the 
chmod -R g+s
 command for each NFS directory instead.
4
. 
Run the following command.
If you are using the same base directory for all NFS volumes, run the 
chmod -R g+w <base directory>
 command. For
example:
chmod -R g+w /var/vols/itom
Alternatively, repeat the 
chmod -R g+w
 command for each NFS directory instead.
Note
 Before performing the following steps, you must mount your managed NFS storage server to the control
plane node. For example:
mkdir /mountPoint
sudo mount -t nfs <NFS Server IP>:/ /mountPoint/
