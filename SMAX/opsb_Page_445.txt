Logs
Locations
Log files are created in various places throughout the lifecycle of installation and running of OMT and Suites.
Node level logging for the OMT embedded Kubernetes
Container logs
Application logs on external volumes
Aggregated logs on external volumes (if FluentBit is configured to aggregate)
The table below describes more details about the OMT processes and components:
Type
Location or command
Contents
Location
Linux syslog
/var/log/messages /
dmesg
Kernel ring buffer contains some messages related to Containerd and other host-
level Kubernetes components such as Kubelet.
Command
crictl logs <container
ID>
Stdout from inside a particular container.
Command
“journalctl -u <unit
name>
Set unit name to following:
Containerd: containerd
Kubectl logs: kubelet
Location
<OMT installation
directory>/logs/
Component logs for OMT tools, scripts
Location
External NFS or Ceph 
OMT and Suite logs
Location
/var/log/containers
Container stdout/stderr logs collected by Fluentbit
Container logs in pods
Pods can contain multiple containers. For kubectl commands, add –c <name of container> to get individual container logs.
To see what containers are inside a Pod run kubectl describe pod <name of pod> then look for the Init containers: and
containers: section to see what containers make up the pod. Then use the container name as the value for the -c option on
kubectl describe.

Log collection and forwarding
OMT and suites can deploy FluentBit in the following configurations:
DaemonSet for node logs such as /var/log/containers and logs of host components for the OMT embedded Kubernetes
such as Kubelet and Containerd
Deployment for application logs written to external volumes (NFS, Ceph)
Pod sidecar for particular Pod or set of Pods logs
The log provenance is preserved as much as possible, indicating what node, pod and container the log originated.
Logging output can be collected and forwarded to:
an external volume
OBA
ElasticSearch
Splunk
generic http(s) receiver
Log rotation
Log rotation pods are deployed using a Kubernetes Daemonset, therefore it runs on every node.
Logs are either rotated or deleted and are configurable.
One additional log rotation pod is deployed by OMT to handle log rotation on the OMT logging volume.
