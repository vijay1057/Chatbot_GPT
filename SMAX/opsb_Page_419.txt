All of the internal Kubernetes resolution will be unaffected. Hostnames outside of the cluster (including the host nodes) will
have to be statically specified.
For this purpose, customers can specify a fixed hostname-to-IP list using a Kubernetes config map.
Ports
Open port requirements for OMT embedded Kubernetes are listed in the Prepare section in the product documentation.
Applications
Accessing application functionality can be via defined Ingress resources and its controller and/or directly via services exposed
using nodePort or both.
Applications may use:
“clusterIP” services exposed via Ingress resource and Ingress controller in the suite namespace
“nodePort” services available on a particular port on every cluster node
A hybrid of both approaches.
Refer to the application installation/administration guides for details.
