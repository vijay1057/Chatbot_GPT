Determining the entity type and field names
All entity types can be updated using the EMS API (as long as you have a role that allows updating that specific entity type). In
order to create or modify a specific field in an entity, you must know both the entity type and the field name. This information
can be found in the Service Management Automation X interface. Navigate to the ‘Records’ utility (select 
Administration >
Records
 from the main menu) and find the correct entity type using the field in the top left section of the form. The entity
name displayed here is the correct entity type that is used in the REST request.
The field name can be found in the ‘Fields’ tab of the entity definition. It is important to use the value in the “Name” column of
the fields list and not the ‘Multilingual label’ column.  Below the entity type "Request" and the field name "Status" are
highlighted.
