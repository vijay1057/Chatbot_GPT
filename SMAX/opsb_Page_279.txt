Under the “yes” side of the decision add a new automatic task. Select the “set field on related record rule” type and then set
the record type to “Person” with Ids of “entity.RequestForPerson.Id”. The flow of the offering will be that whoever is selected in
Requested For Person will be the user who gets the information updated(other person fields could be used).
In the “set” section, add the first field that needs to be updated with the user options created in the previous step. A separate
task needs to be added for every field to see if they are empty or not.
Use the “Path to” option to then join the “no” path onto the next field check because no operation is needed when the
decisions moves through no.
