OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) components require the whole cluster node time in sync. You must make sure that time
is synchronized on all nodes required for deployment. You can use any method determined by your system administrator to
synchronize time across all your systems. 
You may use chrony to synchronize time across operating systems. You must have a time server prepared for the time
synchronization.

. 
On the first control plane node, run the following command to install the chrony client:
yum install chrony -y
2
. 
Run the following commands to create the drift file.
mkdir -p /var/lib/chrony
echo > /var/lib/chrony/driftfile
3
. 
Run the following commands to configure the chrony client. Replace the <Time Server Name or IP Address> placeholder
with the host name or IPv4 address of your time server. You can use a public time server if your cluster can access the
Internet. Otherwise, use an existing time server of the organization or create a time server.
cat <<ENDFILE >/etc/chrony.conf
server <Time Server Name or IP Address> iburst
driftfile /var/lib/chrony/driftfile
stratumweight 0
rtcsync
makestep 0.1 3
ENDFILE
4
. 
Run the following commands to enable and start the chrony service:
systemctl enable chronyd
systemctl start chronyd
5
. 
Run the following command to synchronize the operating system time with the NTP server:
chronyc -a makestep
6
. 
Run the following command to restart the chrony daemon:
systemctl restart chronyd
7
. 
Run the following command to check the server time synchronization:
timedatectl
If your terminal resembles the following with the 
NTP synchronized
 set to "yes" , then you have successfully synchronized
the time on the host with the time server.
[root@ ~]# timedatectl  status
      Local time: Thu 2020-07-21 13:05:21 CST
  Universal time: Thu 2020-07-21 05:05:21 UTC
        RTC time: Thu 2020-07-21 05:05:21
       Time zone: Asia/Shanghai (CST, +0800)
     NTP enabled: yes
 NTP synchronized: yes
 RTC in local TZ: no
      DST active: n/a
8
. 
Run the following command to synchronize the hardware time from the current system time:
hwclock -w
9
. 
Repeat these steps on all other control plane nodes (if any) and the worker nodes. You must also synchronize the time on
the NFS servers, load balancers, and database servers once you have created them.
Note: Make sure that the Kubernetes cluster nodes can reach the Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers (either
internal organization based or external internet based NTP servers).
