Install Audit on-premises
This section gives the steps required to install the Audit service.
Prepare the certificates
You need to copy the database and IDM certificates (base64 encoded) in the same folder where you have downloaded the
Audit Helm chart (for example, 
audit-2022.11)
. 
Generate vault secrets
A secret is an object that has sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key.
Use the
 gen_secrets.sh
 script to create secrets. This script creates a YAML file that contains all the Audit secrets. You must
pass this YAML file in the command line during Audit installation. 
To generate vault secrets for the Audit charts, perform the following steps on the control plane node:
1
. 
Run the following command:
$CDF_HOME/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n <Audit Namespace> -c <Audit Chart File> -o <Secrets YAML File>
Where,
<Audit Namespace>
 is the unique namespace of the Audit deployment.
<Audit Chart File>
 is the tar file containing the Audit installation charts (
audit-<version>.tgz
)
<Secrets YAML File>
 is the YAML file that stores the Audit secrets. Specify the file name (for example, 
audit-
secrets.yaml
), and then the script will generate this YAML file after you run the script. You will need to use this file when
you run the command to install Audit later.
For example:
/opt/cdf/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n auditns -c audit-<version>.tgz -o audit-secrets.yaml
2
. 
The vault secret utility prompts you for the following passwords: 
audit_db_pass_key
,
 idm_transport_user_pass_key
,
and
 idm_super_user_pass_key
. IdM must have the IdM transport user and the super user (suite admin). If you want to
use new users, give the transport user and super user permissions to these users.
The following table describes the vault secret keys:
Key
Required
Description
audit_db_pass_key
Yes
Audit database password.
idm_transport_user_pass_key
Yes
IdM transport user password.
idm_super_user_pass_key
Yes
IdM super user password. For example, if you use 
suite admin
 as the
super user, then give the password of the 
suite admin
.
IdM transport user password
Following is a command to retrieve the idmTransportUser password from the IdM container:
kubectl exec <IDM POD> -n itsma-qcml0 -c idm -- get_secret idm_transport_user_password_secret_key
For example,
kubectl exec idm-7b87f8bbfc-bwswl -n itsma-qcml0 -c idm -- get_secret idm_transport_user_password_secret_key
Install Audit service
To complete the deployment, you will need to install the Audit service using Helm.
Run the following command:
$helm install audit <Audit Service Chart> -n <Audit Namespace> -f values.yaml -f <Secrets YAML File> --set-file "caCertificates.cert_one\.crt"=/path/to/cert_one.crt --set-file "caCertificates.cert_two\.crt"=/path/to/cert_two.crt
Where,
<
Audit Service Chart
> is the tar file containing the Audit installation charts.
<Audit 
Namespace
> is the unique namespace you created for the Audit service.
<
Values YAML File
> is your 
values.yaml 
file with properties configured for the Audit deployment.
