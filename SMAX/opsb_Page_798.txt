 For EBS backend storage, including EBS backend storage used for OS storage and overlay2, and EBS backend RDS services,
you may switch to IO1 instead of GP2 for better performance. For more details, see the AWS documents

Hardware requirements for bastion
The following table lists the minimum resources needed for setting up a bastion in the cloud.

EBS/General purpose SSD (gp2)
100 GB
CentOS 7 (x86_64) - with Updates HVM
 
Note:
 t2.micro is for daily operations while m5.large is for migration and other operations that require more computing
resources and network bandwidth.
Additional hardware requirements for OO
The following sizing requirements denote the target deployment size for a dedicated OO database, based on the number of
tenants. This is not based on concurrent users.
To deploy OO for a 5-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here
.
To deploy OO for a 20-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here
.

Additional hardware requirements for DND & OO
The system requirements for SMA and Design and Deploy (DND) can be planned while installing SMA or at a later point when
you are deploying DND on an existing SMA setup. The table includes the hardware requirements for OO also as it is mandatory
for DND to work.
A standard deployment includes control plane nodes (owned by AWS), worker nodes, EFS as storage, and RDS as databases.
First, make sure that you have determined your SMA deployment size by using the table in the "SMA size definitions" section. 
Then, use the following table to determine your DND deployment size. Note that this table applies for one DND instance. If you
will enable DND for multiple tenants (one DND Instance for each tenant), you need to determine the deployment size of each
individual DND instance.
