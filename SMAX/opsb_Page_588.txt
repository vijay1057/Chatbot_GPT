Restart the HAProxy service:
#systemctl stop haproxy
#systemctl start haproxy

Make sure you can connect to the PostgreSQL service through the virtual IP by running the following commands on a host
where "psql" is available:
#psql -h <virtual ip address> -p 5000 -d postgres -U postgres
Use SSL to connect to PostgreSQL:
psql "host=<virtual ip address> port=5000 dbname=postgres user=postgres password=<password> sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=<root c
a certificate>"
Test the Keepalived service for HAProxy
In the following example,  haproxy1 has an IP address of16.155.194.54, haproxy2 has an IP address of 16.155.198.152, and
the virtual IP is 16.155.194.119.

. 
Verify the virtual IP as follows:
a
. 
On haproxy1, run the following command:
#ip addr show dev ens160
b
. 
On haproxy2, run the following command:
#ip addr show dev ens160
2
. 
Check the Keepalived service log:
a
. 
On haproxy1, run the following command:
#journalctl -u keepalived -f
The Keepalived service on this host is "Entering MASTER STATE."
The gratuitous ARP is sent for the virtual IP (16.155.194.119).
b
. 
On haproxy2, run the following command:
#journalctl -u keepalived -f
The Keepalived service on this host is "Entering BACKUP STATE."
