Azure
The address of an image in an Azure container registry includes the following elements:
[loginUrl]/[namespace]/[artifact:][tag]
loginUrl - The fully qualified name of the registry host. The registry host in an Azure container registry is
in this format: 
myregistry
.azurecr.io (all lowercase). You must specify the loginUrl when using Docker or
other client tools to pull or push artifacts to an Azure container registry.
namespace - Slash-delimited logical grouping of related images or artifacts - for example, for a
workgroup or app.
artifact - The name of a repository for a particular image or artifact.
tag - A specific version of an image or artifact stored in a repository.
An organization name in our documentation refers to a "namespace" in Azure.
For example, the full name of an image in an Azure container registry might look like the following:
itomsma.azurecr.io/hpeswitomsandbox/itom-idm:1.26.0
The organization name in this example is hpeswitomsandbox.
GCP
The address of an image in an GCP container registry includes the following elements:
gcr.io/[your-project-id]/[image]:[tag]
An organization name in our documentation refers to a "project-id" in GCR. A project-id is the ID of your
Google Cloud project. For example, the full name of an image in GCR may look like the following:
gcr.io/itom-smax-nonprod/itom-cdf-controller:0.2.0-005
The organization name in this example is itom-smax-nonprod.
AWS
The address of an image in an AWS container registry includes the following elements:
[aws_account_id].dkr.ecr.[region].amazonaws.com/[Repository name]:[tag]
You can push images to ECR like this:
114706266704.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hpeswitomsandbox/itom-autopass-lms:latest
In this example, the organization name for ECR is hpeswitomsandbox.
Docker
hub
Organizations are collections of teams and repositories that can be managed together. SMA uses an
organization name of "hpeswitom" to manage all SMA repositories.
You can pull images from Docker Hub like this:
itom-docker.shcartifactory.swinfra.net/hpeswitom/vault:0.12.0-0016
The organization name for all Docker Hub repositories for SMA is hpeswitom.

Is the load balancer working on layer 4 or layer 7?  Why do we need both layer 4 and layer 7 load balancers?
Basically, we leverage solutions with both layer 4 and layer 7 load balancers. They work together to serve different purposes.
A layer 7 load balancer is introduced for application level scenarios:
Rule-based routing. In a production environment, there may be multiple applications behind the load balancer, such as
SMA and HCM. You may need a load balancer to redirect you to different applications based on the context path. For
example, requests against 
www.microfocus.com/saw
 and 
www.microfocus.com/bo
 should be redirected to SMA, and
requests against 
www.microfocus.com/hcm
 to HCM.
Working with a Web Application Firewall for security considerations
Providing SSL/TLS encryption at the load balancer level
A layer 4 load balancer is introduced for infrastructure and network level scenarios:
A layer 4 load balancer can work with cloud-native Kubernetes so that it can notice any node-level changes and update its
backend pool
It provides the capacity for handling thousands to millions of requests with very low latency
Is it possible for a worker node to run out of disk space over time?
Yes, it's possible, but not very likely. There are always some unused files left on a worker node (for example, image files, old
version resources). You can monitor your disk usage on a regular basis just in case. 
Can I choose for a worker node an instance type other than the one required in the sizing guide? 
Technically, you can, but with certain limitations. You can only choose an instance type with the same or a higher
configuration than the requirements (disk size, CPU, etc) documented in the sizing guide, to avoid problems caused by
resource insufficiency.
Can I choose other operating systems than CentOS for the Bastion node?
