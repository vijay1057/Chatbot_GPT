BASH Shell Requirements
All shell scripts included in 
Vertica
 must run under the BASH shell. If you are on a Debian system, then the default shell can be
DASH. DASH is not supported. Change the shell for root and for the dbadmin user to BASH with the 
chsh
 command.
For example:
# getent passwd | grep root
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/dash
# chsh
Changing shell for root.
New shell [/bin/dash]: /bin/bash
Shell changed.
Then, as root, change the symbolic link for 
/bin/sh
 from 
/bin/dash
 to 
/bin/bash
:
# rm /bin/sh
# ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh
Log out and back in for the change to take effect.
