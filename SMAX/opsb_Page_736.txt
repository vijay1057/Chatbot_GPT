Download OO container images
To install an application, you need to download the required installation images. You need to:
Generate an image download tool package.
Run the download script inside the tool package to download the required installation images.
Generate the download bundle
The 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 compares the images listed in the 
image-set.json
 file with the images that already exist
in the specified image organization of the specified registry. It will only download the missing images.
1
. 
Log on to the first control plane node.
2
. 
Run the following command to change the directory. 
cd  ${CDF_HOME}/tools/generate-download
3
. 
Run the command together with the options required by your deployment. For example, run the following command:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart <OO helm chart file> -o <org name> [-d <destination dir>]
Where
:
<OO helm chart file>:
 The absolute path to the OO Helm chart .tgz archive - ie: 
oo-1.0.x+2022xx01-xx/oo-helm-charts/charts/
oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx.tgz.
<org name>:
 The organization in the image registry that contains the installation images. By default, it's 
hpeswitom
.
<destination dir>:
 The directory where the output .zip file is created. The default location is the current directory.
The generate_download_bundle.sh compares the images needed by the suite with the images that already exist in the
cluster, and generates a .zip file, offline-download.zip, that enables you to download the required images from Docker
Hub.
For example:
./generate_download_bundle.sh --chart oo-1.0.x+2022xx01-xx/oo-helm-charts/charts/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01.xx.tgz -o hpeswitom
The script saves the 
offline-download.zip
 file under the current working directory. To save the file in a different directory,
use the "-d" option to specify a new directory. You will receive the following messages indicating that you have
successfully generated the offline-download.zip file:
[INFO] 2020-07-31 17:58:46 : ** Generating the offline image download bundle ...
[INFO] 2020-07-31 17:58:50 : Completed generation of offline-download.zip in /tmp
Download the required installation images
1
. 
Log on to the first control plane node. If the first control plane node can't access Docker Hub, transfer the  
offline-down
load.zip
  file to a Linux server that can access Docker Hub.
2
. 
Extract the .zip package to a directory. If you can't access Docker Hub directly, set up the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. For
example, run the following commands to set the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Replace the placeholders with your actual server
and port. 
export http_proxy="<http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
export https_proxy="<https://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
3
. 
Go to the directory where you extracted the 
offline-download.zip
 package.
4
. 
Run the following command:
./downloadimages.sh [-r <image repository URL>] [-u <username>]  [-d <image download directory>] [-c on|off] [-o <org name>]
Where:
<image repository URL>: Specify the 
-r
 option if you want to download the images from a repository other than
Docker Hub.
Replace <
username
> with the Docker Hub username.
If you don't specify the credentials here, you will be prompted to specify them when you run the command.
<image download directory>: The directory where the container images will download. The default value is
/var/opt/cdf/offline.
The 
-c
 option is used to verify the digital signature of the images during the download. The default setting is off,
which doesn't verify the signature.
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the installation images. By default, this is 
hpes
witom.
 This option is mandatory if you aren't using the default organization name.
To see the full list of options for the downloadimages.sh command, run the following command:
./downloadimages.sh –h
The command also has a 
-p
 option to provide your password. The 
-p
 option doesn't support single quotes (in other words,
don't include single quotes in the password).
