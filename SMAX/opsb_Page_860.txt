Check and download the container images (FIPS mode)
On the 
Download Images
 page, the installer checks whether you have downloaded the required images. If not, the installer
will guide you to download the missing images. 
1
. 
On the 
Download Images
 page, click 
Next
 .
2
. 
On the 
Check Image Availability
 page, wait until the image check finishes.
3
. 
If all the images are available in the registry, click 
NEXT
 to continue the infrastructure deployment. 
4
. 
If there are some images missing, go through the below sections to transfer the images.
Generate the image set
Before downloading and uploading the images, you need to generate the image set with the following steps:
1
. 
Run the following command to change directory:
cd /<OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx>/tools/generate-download
2
. 
Run the following command to display the command-line options for the 
generate_download_bundle
 command: 
./generate_download_bundle.sh -h
3
. 
Run the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 command together with the options required by your deployment. FIPS currently does
not support DND, CGRO, SAM, sm-gateway, hence use -F X to only generate images for X features. For example: Replace
all the placeholders with the actual values.
./generate_download_bundle.sh -m <suite metadata> -F X -s itsma -v <suite version> -o hpeswitom -d <offline-download.zip location>
For example:
./generate_download_bundle.sh -m /directory/containing/suite-metadata.tgz -F X -s itsma -v 202x.xx -o hpeswitom -d /tmp
The 
offline-download.zip
 will be placed in the 
/tmp
 directory as specified.
4
. 
Run the following command to remove pg images from ECR
sed -i-e'/pgha/,+1d'-e'$!N;/\n.*pgha/!P;D' image-set.json
The image set file 
image-set.json
 is located in the current directory. This file contains a list of the required images and will be
used when you run the Python script to transfer the suite images in the later step.
Create ECR repositories
Before pushing images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), you need to create a repository for each image.
To do this, copy and save the script below as 
create_aws_repositories.py
 to 
OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
 on the bastion:
import os
import subprocess
import time
import sys
import json
import argparse
import logging
from collections import OrderedDict
from subprocess import CalledProcessError
logFile = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) + '/create_aws_repositories.log'
if os.path.exists(logFile):
    os.remove(logFile)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,
                    format='%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s',
                    datefmt='%m-%d %H:%M', filename=logFile, filemode='w')
console = logging.StreamHandler()
Important
 Note that if you have downloaded and uploaded images to the registry at the 
Prepare
 phase and
the installation process takes 12 hours or longer, you may receive an error resembling 
0 of 96 required images are av
ailable in the registry
 on the 
Check Image Availability
 page. See 
0 of X required images are available in the
registry
 for more information.

Note:
 To follow the steps in this section, you must have installed the 
zip
 Linux command on the node where you
run the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 script.
