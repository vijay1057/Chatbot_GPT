. 
Check if a file named 
/<root>/.kube/config
 with cluster credentials exists. If not, log in to the Azure CLI by running the
command below and following the instructions in the command output:
sudo az login
Then, run the following command to get the required permission to run the Kubernetes commands:
sudo az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <kubernetes_cluster_name> --subscription <subscription_name_or_id>
In this command,
<resource_group_name>
 is the name of the resource group you created on the 
Build AKS cluster
 page. Do 
NOT
use your cluster's resource group name with the format 
MC_<resource_group>_<aks_cluster_name>_<location>
.
<kubernetes_cluster_name>
 is the name of the created Kubernetes cluster.
<subscription_name_or_id>
 is your subscription name or ID. You can get it by navigating to the Azure portal 
Home

Select one of the following options to create Persistent Volumes for the suite.
If you use 
Azure Files & Azure Disks
 as the storage service:
First, you need to generate the secret under the suite namespace for Kubernetes to access the Azure file shares:
kubectl create secret generic azure-secret --from-literal=azurestorageaccountname=<storage_account_name> --from-literal=azurestorageaccountkey=<storage_account_key> -n <suite_namespace>
In this command,
<storage_account_name>
 is the name of the FileStorage account created.
<storage_account_key>
 is the key you obtained for the FileStorage account created.
<suite_namespace>
 is the suite namespace created automatically by OMT (for example: 
itsma-etgsg
). You
can find it by running command 
kubectl get ns |grep itsma-
.
Then, create Persistent Volumes for the suite by running the script you saved at the 
Configure volumes
 step:
sudo ./createPV.sh  -n <suite_namespace> -gp <generic_file_share_name>/var/vols/itom/itsma -u <system_user_id> -g <system_group_id> -m <suite_metadata_path> -v <suite_version> -s <suite_size>
In this command,
<suite namespace>
 is the suite namespace created automatically by OMT (for example: 
itsma-etgsg
). You
can find it by running command 
kubectl get ns |grep itsma-
.
<generic_file_share_name>
 is the name of the Azure file share for storing the 
generic
 data.
<system_user_id>
 and 
<system_group_id>
: enter the 
<system_user_id>
 and 
<system_group_id>
 values
 
that you
specified previously in 
Subscribe premium Azure Files & Azure Disks
.
<suite_metadata_path>
 is the directory of the suite metadata. For example, 
/root/itsma-suite-metadata-
xxx.xx.tgz
.
<suite_version>
 is the suite version.
<suite_size>
 is the deployment size of the suite. Use one of the following values: 
SMALL
, 
MEDIUM
, or 
LAR
GE
.
You can find them by navigating to the Azure portal > 
Storage accounts
 > your storage account > 
File
shares
 > your Azure file share name.
If you use 
Azure NetApp Files 
as the storage service:
Create Persistent Volumes for the suite by running the script you saved at the 
Configure volumes for NetApp
Files
