7. Create task plan in the offering to update the fields
The System Administration portal runs a sync every night that will update any changes to the Phone Number or Name of users,
so these fields shouldn’t be modified. Contacts are not updated by the sync so most fields can be updated. Also note that the
UPN field cannot be changed after the contact or user is created. The task plan needs to use a decision to see if the user
option has been populated so it does not save an empty value into the person record overwriting what is already there. Once
completed the task plan will look similar to the example below. Add the task plan to the fulfill tab (unless an approval is
desired). The decision tree examples are below.
Create a new decision for First name, and add the check to see if the user option is populated, the expression is
${entity.UserOptions.FirstName_c!=null}. If the field is populated then it will proceed through the Yes path onto the
automated task to populate the field in the person record.
