An Incident encompasses any disruption or degradation of a service, whether the service is internal or external. Issues with
redundant hardware (or software) are also handled as an incident, even if the degradation isn't apparent to an end user.
The goal of the incident management process is to resolve the disruption or degradation as quickly as possible. This may often
involve enacting a workaround (such as rebooting a server or restarting a specific service) rather than a permanent fix.
We highly recommend reviewing the 
Incident Management chapter
 in the Getting Started guide before starting your
implementation.

Setting up problem management
A problem is simply the cause of one or more incidents. The aim of the problem process is to minimize the impact of known
problems on consumers and prevent recurring incidents.
Problem management encompasses the activities required to diagnose the root cause of incidents and determine short term
workarounds and long term resolutions to those problems. It's also responsible for ensuring the correct resolutions are
implemented through the correct control processes such as change management and release management.
For more information, see 
Problem Management chapter
 of the Getting Started guide.

Setting up Change Management
Changes to IT infrastructure may be necessary to respond to problems or externally imposed requirements and to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of existing services. The change management process ensures that standardized methods,
processes, and procedures are used for all changes to give efficient and safe handling of all changes to the infrastructure, and
is used to determine that the need for change outweighs the potential detrimental impact of changes.
The 
Change Management chapter
 of the Getting Started guide contains additional information on setting up the module.
