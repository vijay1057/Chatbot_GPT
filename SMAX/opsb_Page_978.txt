Deploy Audit on AWS (EKS)
This section provides the steps required to install the Audit service on AWS (EKS).
Generate vault secrets for the Audit charts
Perform the following tasks to generate vault secrets for the Audit charts:
1
. 
On the bastion node, navigate to the CDF installation directory:
cd ITOM_Platform_Foundation_BYOK_20xx.xx.xxxxx/scripts/
2
. 
Run the following command to generate vault secrets:
./gen_secrets.sh -n <NAMESPACE> -c <AUDIT CHART FILE> -o <SECRETS YAML FILE>
Where:
<
NAMESPACE
>
 is the unique namespace of the Audit deployment.
<
AUDIT CHART FILE
>
 is the tar file containing the Audit installation charts (audit-<version>.tgz).
<
SECRETS YAML FILE
>
 is the YAML file that stores the Audit secrets. Specify the file name (for example, 
audit-
secrets.yaml
), and then the script will generate this YAML file after you run the script. You will need to use this file
when you run the command to install Audit later.
For example:
/opt/cdf/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n itomns -c audit-<version>.tgz -o audit-secrets.yaml
3
. 
The

 Vault secret utility prompts you for the following passwords:
Key
Required
Description
audit-db-pass-key
Yes
Audit database password.
audit-transport-user-pass-key
Yes
IDM Transport user password.
idm-super-user-pass-key
Yes
IDM Super user password.
Install Audit service
To complete the deployment, you will need to install the Audit service using Helm.
Run the following command:
$helm install audit <Audit Service Chart> -n <NAMESPACE> -f values.yaml -f audit-secrets.yaml --set-file "caCertificates.cert_one\.crt"=/path/to/cert_one.crt --set-file "caCertificates.cert_two\.crt"=/path/to/cert_two.crt
Where,
<
Audit Service Chart
>
 is the tar file containing the Audit installation charts.
<
NAMESPACE
>
 is the unique namespace you created for the Audit service.
<
VALUES YAML FILE
>
 is your 
values.yaml 
file with properties configured for the Audit deployment.
The certificates are passed by using the --set-file option. In the below example, we can see IdM, DB, and Internal ALB
certificates are passed.
Note : The Internal ALB certificate is passed as the communication between Audit gateway and Audit engine is
through internal ALB.
For example:
$helm install audit audit-<version>.tgz -n itomns -f values.yaml -f audit-secrets.yaml --set-file "caCertificates.RE_ca_idmcrt"=./RE_ca_idm.crt --set-file "caCertificates.RE_ca_dbcrt"=./RE_ca_db.crt --set-file "caCertificates.RE_ca_intAlb"=./RE_ca_intAlb.crt
Verify the installation
To verify if you have installed the Audit service successfully, do the following:
1
. 
Log in to the bastion node.
2
. 
Run the following command to make sure that all pods are ready:
kubectl get pod -n <
NAMESPACE
> |grep -v 1/1|grep -v 2/2|grep -v 3/3|grep -v 4/4|grep -v Completed
Where:
<
NAMESPACE
>
 is the namespace where you have deployed the Audit Helm chart.
