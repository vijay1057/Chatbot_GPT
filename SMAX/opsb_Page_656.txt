Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter sets the host field of all ingress resources to the external access host of the deployment. If the parameter is set
to "false", the host field remains empty.
The default value is "false". This release supports only the default value.
Example:
 
SET_FQDN_IN_INGRESS= false
ENABLE_FIPS
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter enables suites to enable and disable FIPS.
If you enable FIPS mode on the VMs of the cluster nodes, make sure you have set the parameter 
ENABLE_FIPS
 to "true".
Likewise, if you have set the parameter 
ENABLE_FIPS
 to "false", make sure you have turned off the FIPS mode on the VMs of the
cluster nodes.
The expected value is "true" or "false".
The default value is "false".
Example:
ENABLE_FIPS="true"
FIPS_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter configures the minimal entropy value on the cluster nodes. When OMT runs in FIPS mode, components may
stop responding if the entropy falls below the value specified by this parameter, and may not start responding again until
entropy has risen above this value. To check the current entropy on a node, run the 
tail -1 /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
command. We recommend that you install an entropy generation tool (such as "rng-tools") to ensure that every node has
sufficient entropy. To install rng-tools, run the 
yum install rng-tools
 or 
dnf install rng-tools
 command. 
The expected value is a number greater than 0.
The default value is "2000".
Example:
FIPS_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD="2000"
Log collection settings
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_URL
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter specifies the URL of the log receiver service on which the fluentd log output files are located. Configure this
parameter and the 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_TYPE
 parameter if you want to use an Elasticsearch server or Operations Bridge
Analytics as the remote OMT logs location. If you don't configure the 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_URL
 and 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_TYP
E
 parameters, the 
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_TYPE
 parameter will be configured to the value 
file
. In this case, you must export an
NFS persistent volume on an NFS server and configure it to the 
itom-logging-vol
 volume when you run the installation on the
installation portal.
If the connection to the log receiver requires a proxy, you must configure the 
CRT_HTTP_PROXY
, 
CRT_HTTPS_PROXY
, and 
CRT_NO_P
ROXY
 parameters.
Example:
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_URL="https://www.mylogtarget.com"
FLUENTD_LOG_RECEIVER_USER
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter specifies the username of the account that's used to log in to the log receiver server.
Example:
Note:
 
The 
rngd
 service does not start by default. You must run the 
systemctl enable rngd; systemctl start rngd
command to enable it. In most cases, 
rngd-tools
 is sufficient to generate entropy very fast. However, we've
observed that 
rngd-tools
 can't generate enough entropy quickly on some servers. In this situation, please also
install, enable, and start the 
havegd
 service.
