Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter specifies whether to ignore some failed worker nodes for silent installation in helm mode. If this parameter is
set to 
true
, silent installation will continue even some of the worker nodes failed. 
The expected value is 
true
 or 
false
.
The default value is 
true
.
Example:
SKIP_FAILED_WORKER_NODE="true"
AUTO_CONFIGURE_FIREWALL
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter specifies whether the required firewall rules are automatically added when the node is deployed. If the value is
set to 
true
, the firewall rules are configured automatically. This parameter is disabled if no firewall is configured on the node.
The expected value is 
true
 or 
false
.
The default value is 
true
.
Example:
AUTO_CONFIGURE_FIREWALL="true"
HA_VIRTUAL_IP
Configuration of this parameter is mandatory if you are configuring multiple control plane nodes in a single subnet and if you
haven't configured the 
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST
 parameter.
This parameter specifies the virtual IP address that's shared by the control plane nodes in an HA environment. OMT uses
Keepalived to provide failover for the IP address that clients use to access the installed ITOM services. This IP address is a
virtual IP address that's assigned to one of the three OMT cluster control plane nodes. If a control plane node fails, the virtual
IP address is assigned to an active control plane node. This setup helps to provide high availability for the ITOM services.
The expected value is any free IP address in the subnet that will hold the cluster control plane nodes. The IP address mustn't
be occupied and it mustn't be changed or updated. The virtual IP address and every control plane node must exist in the same
network subnet. If the network contains a DNS server, create a DNS entry for the virtual IP address so clients can use this
name to find the ITOM services running in the OMT cluster.
Example:
HA_VIRTUAL_IP="192.0.2.0"
KEEPALIVED_NOPREEMPT
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter specifies whether Keepalived runs in preempt mode. The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) will
normally preempt a lower priority machine when higher priority machines come online. "nopreempt" allows the lower priority
machine to maintain the control plane role, even when a higher priority machine comes back online. But default, the
parameter 
KEEPALIVED_NOPREEMPT
 is set to "true", which means the Keepalived is in "nopreempt" mode. If you want the cluster
are in preempt mode, set the 
KEEPALIVED_NOPREEMPT
 to "false".
The default value is 
true
.
Example:
KEEPALIVED_NOPREEMPT="true"
KEEPALIVED_VIRTUAL_ROUTER_ID
Configuration of this parameter is optional. This parameter is only used for multiple control plane nodes with HA via
Keepalived.
This parameter specifies the virtual router ID for Keepalived. This ID is unique for each cluster in the same network. However,
all nodes in the same cluster should use the same value. When a value is occupied, the new cluster will use a different value.
The expected value must fall in the range of 0-255.
The default value is 
51
.
Example:
KEEPALIVED_VIRTUAL_ROUTER_ID="51"
