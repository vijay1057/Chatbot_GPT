OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT)
What is OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) ?
OPTIC Management Toolkit provides the necessary tooling for installing and running containerized ITOM applications on
Kubernetes.
“
OMT
” is “Application Hub” + “embedded K8s” + “CLI Tools”
Application Hub 
is an application for managing our containerized applications / suites - deployment management and monitoring:
 UI for Helm based deployments
 Supports non-Helm Installs suites too via legacy UI/CLI
 Some basic cluster admin functions for the embedded K8s
 Cluster-wide monitoring of the deployed applications (via Prometheus)- need to ensure simple UX.
The Kubernetes instance(s) can be existing hosted or on-premise. This is referred to as external Kubernetes.
External Kubernetes is subdivided into 2 categories:
1
. 
Managed Kubernetes: fully supported on application and infrastructure level
2
. 
Bring Your Own Kubernetes (BYOK): fully supported on the application level, best effort on infrastructure level.
In case customers do have existing external Kubernetes instance(s) then they can install and use the OMT embedded
Kubernetes.
OMT also provides a set of reusable components that ITOM applications deploy integrated in their offering.
A customer may choose not to install Application Hub and work only with CLIs (Helm and other CLIs) if the ITOM application can be
installed using Helm charts.
Architecture
The following diagram explain the functional composition of the OMT with or without the embedded Kubernetes.
