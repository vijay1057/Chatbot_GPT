Prepare external databases for CMS (AKS)
CMS contains an internal (embedded) PostgreSQL database instance, which should be used for demonstration purposes only.
You must use external databases in a production environment. In addition, you must use separate PostgreSQL databases
instances for SMAX and the containerized CMS.
For the CMS deployed on Azure, you need to set up an Azure flexible server as the database engine. This flexible server
instance will be used as the external databases for the following CMS components:
UCMDB Server
AutoPass License Service (APLS)
Set up an Azure flexible server
To set up an Azure flexible server, follow these steps.
1
. 
Go to the Azure portal (
https://portal.azure.com
).
2
. 
Search for "Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible servers" and open it.
3
. 
Click 
Create
.
4
. 
On the creation page, enter the following information.
Project details
Subscriptions
: Enter your subscription ID. You can get it from the 
Azure portal Home
page
 > 
Subscriptions
.
Resource group
: Enter the name of the resource group created in the prerequisite tasks. For example,
myResourceGroup.
Server details
Server name
: Enter a name for the flexible server. For example: 
cmspghost
.
Region
: Choose a region. Ideally, your database should be in the same region as your production environment.
Workload type:
 Select a workload type according to your needs.
Compute + storage
: Click 
Configure server
, then choose the compute size according to the 
Sizing
considerations for Azure deployment
. Click 
Save
.
Availability Zone
: No preference.
High availability
  
Check 
Enable high availability
 as needed.
PostgreSQL Version
: Choose the PostgreSQL version. For details about supported PostgreSQL versions, see
Support matrix for Azure deployment
.
Administrator account
Admin username
: Name your database administrator. 
Password
: Set the password for the admin.
Confirm password
: Confirm the password.
5
. 
Click 
Next: Networking
. Enter the following information.
Connectivity method
: Select 
Private access(Vnet Integration) 
>
 Virtual network
.
Subscription: 
Enter your subscription ID. You can get it from the 
Azure portal Home page
 > 
Subscriptions
.
Virtual network:
 Select the Vnet you created for the CMS production environment.
Subnet:
 Select a subnet different from the one you prepared for CMS. Or, enter a nonexistent subnet name and let
the system create it. Please be aware that this subnet must be independent and can't be shared with other objects.
6
. 
Click 
Review + create
.
7
. 
Download the root CA. To do this, go to the 
Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server
 page, click the
Networking
 section, then click 
Download SSL Certificate
.
You will need to select the 
Use SSL connection
 option and add this certificate to the 
caCertificates 
section when
you 
Create my-values.yaml (AKS)
 during the CMS installation.  
8
. 
Check and validate if the database is ready. You can either:
After installing the PostgreSQL client on the bastion, run the following command to check the database:
psql "host=<fqdn of flexible server> port=5432 dbname=postgres user=<postgres_admin> password=<password for admin> sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=<full path of the root CA certificate>"
Or use pgAdmin and use the bastion as the SSH Tunnel. With pgAdmin4 version 6.5+, you can do this by configuring
the SSH Tunnel.
Note:
 If you want to use a plain connection instead of TLS to the flexible server, you can go to Server parameters and use
require_secure_transport to turn off the SSL force.
Set up PostgreSQL databases for CMS
In a production environment, you must use external databases for the CMS application. The database user and database name
information are required when you install CMS, and the database schema information is required for UCMDB Server, but
optional for AutoPass. The default schema name will be used if there is no new schema name assigned.
The databases must be empty so that CMS will initialize them during installation. The table below shows example database
information prepared for the four components.
Service
DB User
DB Name
Schema (default)
Important
: This release no longer supports the method of installing PostgreSQL on a virtual machine on
Azure. You must
