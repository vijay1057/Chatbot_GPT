Timing and Caching
It probably won't surprise you, but there is a ton of processing going on behind the scenes to calculate all the service level
targets and related actions for all the incidents and requests being opened. Service Management Automation X has to perform
complex calculations which included time periods (and time zones) every time someone creates or updates a request or
incident.
To optimize performance, Service Management Automation X performs the calculations in small batches in the background so
that the end users and agents aren't negatively affected. The small side-effect of this is that the calculations might not be
visible to the agents for up to a minute. So we need to let our agents know that if they don't see a target time in a record they
recently created or updated, they need to give it a few seconds and it will appear.
One other area that the optimization work affects is in changing the actual service level targets. To keep performance at its
peak, the internal caching mechanisms used may not take the new values into consideration for a few minutes. In fact, the
system will warn us of this when we change the targets. It's possible to override this behavior if necessary, but we need to
make sure we only do this when we have to.
