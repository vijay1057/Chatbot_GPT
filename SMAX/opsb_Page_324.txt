The filename is specified within the ‘Content-Disposition’ line. The line should read: 
Content-Disposition:form-data;
name="files[]"; filename="test.txt"
, where “test.txt” is replaced with whatever the attachment filename should be inside
of Service Management Automation X.
The type of the attachment is specified as the ‘Content-Type’ tag. This value should contain the media type and subtype that
matches the attachment’s MIME type. You can find a list of these MIME types 
here
.
Finally, the contents of the attachment are listed. In the example below, the content is a simple string. This will result in a text
file created in Service Management Automation X containing this string, with a filename of “test.txt”.
Once all of the information is entered into the request, press the “Send” button to send it to Service Management Automation
X.
Reviewing the Results
After a successful request, the response contains the information that is needed to connect the attachment with a specific
record inside of Service Management Automation X.
Adding a file as an attachment
In order to add a binary file as an attachment, there are a few changes to the procedures listed in Step #1 above. First, the
‘Content-Type’ should not be specified in the headers of the request.
