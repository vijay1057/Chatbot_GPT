follow the same exported path naming rule: <base directory>/<volume label on the web UI>
Once you have turned on the 
Auto-fill
 button, the installer automatically configures the remaining NFS volumes for
you as follows:
File System Type
: same as the file system type that you provided for the first volume.
File Server
: same as the NFS Server hostname or IP address that you provided for the first volume.
Exported Path
: the installer sets this field as 
/<base directory>/<volume label on the web UI>
. For example, if you
provide the <base directory> as 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/
 and the current volume's display label shows 
db-backup-vol
,
the installer automatically populates the exported path field with 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/db-backup-vol
.
