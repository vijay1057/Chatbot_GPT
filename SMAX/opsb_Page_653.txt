FLANNEL_IFACE
Configuration of this parameter is mandatory if you install OMT on a node that has more than one network adapter. The
configuration of this parameter applies to the first control plane node only. For other nodes, specify the values of this
parameter on the installation portal while adding nodes later.
This parameter specifies the interface for Container inter-host communication. If the first control plane node has multiple
network adapters, set the value of the 
FLANNEL_IFACE
 parameter to the network adapter that you want to use for Container
inter-host communication. If the remaining control plane nodes (in an HA configuration) or worker nodes also have multiple
network adapters, you must also select one of these network adapters for Container inter-host communication. However, this
information is specified later. When you add control plane and worker nodes on the installation portal, enter the network
adapters for the additional nodes in the 
Flannel IFace
 text box.
The expected value is an IPv4 address or interface name.
Example:
FLANNEL_IFACE="192.0.2.1"
FLANNEL_BACKEND_TYPE
Configuration of this parameter is mandatory if you are configuring multiple control plane nodes in multiple subnets.
This parameter specifies the backend type of the flannel network. If you set up the OMT cluster nodes in different subnets, set
the value of this parameter to 
vxlan
. If you set up the OMT cluster nodes in the same subnet, set the value of this parameter to
host-gw
.
On clouds (such as, AWS and Azure), the 
FLANNEL_BACKEND_TYPE parameter
 can only be set to 
vxlan
 for a non-
Kubernetes managed deployment. This parameter is invalid in external Kubernetes deployments.
The expected value for this parameter is 
host-gw
 or 
vxlan
.
The default value is 
host-gw
.
Example:
FLANNEL_BACKEND_TYPE="host-gw"
POD_CIDR
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter specifies the network address range for Kubernetes pods. The address range specified in the 
POD_CIDR
parameter mustn't overlap with the IP range assigned for Kubernetes services (specified in the 
SERVICE_CIDR
 parameter).
The expected value is a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format IP address. CIDR notation comprises of an IP address, a
slash ('/') character, and a network prefix (a decimal number). The minimum useful network prefix is 
/24
 and the maximum
useful network prefix is 
/8
.
The default value is 
172.16.0.0/16
. We strongly recommend that you change the default value only when your network
configuration requires you to do so, and to make sure that you have sufficient understanding of the Flannel network fabric
configuration requirements before you make any changes.
Example:
POD_CIDR="172.16.0.0/16"
POD_CIDR_SUBNETLEN
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter specifies the size of the sub-net allocated to each host for Kubernetes pod network addresses.
The default value is dependent on the value of the 
POD_CIDR
 parameter, as described in the following table. We strongly
recommend that you change the default value only when your network configuration requires you to do so. You must also
ensure that you have a sufficient understanding of the Flannel network fabric configuration requirements before you make any
changes.
POD_CIDR prefix
POD_CIDR_SUBNETLEN defaults
POD_CIDR_SUBNETLEN allowed values
/8 to /21
/24
/(POD_CIDR prefix + 3) to /27
/22 to /24
/(POD_CIDR prefix + 3)
/(POD_CIDR prefix + 3) to /27
Smaller prefix values indicate a larger number of available addresses.
Example:
POD_CIDR_SUBNETLEN="24"
