Install Audit Collector on AWS (EKS)
Audit collector is an application built using Spring boot to help collect the audits from the file system and pass it to Audit
service via REST. Audit collector mainly takes care of audits when there is failure in the REST path between Audit producer and
Audit service. Audit collector is deployed using Helm charts.
There are three main components that are involved with the Audit collector: IdM, Audit producer ( which includes the Audit
client ), and Audit service.
The Audit client, which is part of the Audit producer, creates the audits in the file system when the Audit producer fails to
reach the Audit service through REST. Then the Audit collector uses the integration user to push the audit to the Audit service
through REST whenever Audit service is available over REST. Here Audit collector gets the Authentication token for the
Integration user from IdM.
This section describes the steps to install the Audit collector.
