The SMA suite leverages an 
AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
 to distribute the incoming traffic across different
targets.
You first need to create an 
AWS Load Balancer Controller
. It will automatically provision an ALB when you create an
Ingress for port 3000. Later you will need to create Ingress resources for ports 443 and 5443 respectively, which are bound
to the same ALB.
These three ports are used for the following purposes:
Port 3000: used to access the installation portal
Port 5443: used to access the OMT management portal
Port 443: used to access the suite
Step 1: Create AWS Load Balancer Controller
The AWS Load Balancer Controller helps to manage load balancers for a Kubernetes cluster. It will provision an ALB for you
when you create an Ingress. You can create an AWS Load Balancer Controller by referring to the AWS guide:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html
.
Step 2: Prepare a certificate for Application Load Balancer
Before creating an ALB, you need to allocate an FQDN for the suite (for example, via AWS route 53 services by following
the 
AWS document
) if you don't have one. You also need to prepare a certificate for the ALB using 
one of
 the following
methods. Or else, unexpected errors might occur at later steps.
Request a certificate
Important
 The Application Load Balancer (ALB) you will create will be provisioned automatically and managed
by EKS. Please do not configure anything on the ALB manually.
