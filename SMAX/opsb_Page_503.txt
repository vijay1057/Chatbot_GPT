An optional step is to integrate the cost estimation into the Financial Management module of ESM. This might give you
additional tracking and some estimated cost insights. For information about an additional overview and the setup steps,

Known Issues of IaC Gateway
There might be certain scenarios that you get into where after the Terraform state file is saved into IaC Gateway and the
request is issued to ESM, the request gets stuck, and IaC Gateway never gets a subscription id from ESM.
If you run into this issue, you can resolve it by issuing a couple of APIs calls.
API calls
First, run a GET API call to retrieve Terraform state file data out of the database to ensure that the state entries are there in
the database, and then run a DELETE API call to remove the state entries from the database.
1
. 
Run a GET API call to retrieve Terraform state data to validate that the Terraform state entry is in the database.
https://<hostName>/iac-controller/v1/<tenantId>/ terraform/<terraform-state-name>/backend
GET Method
Basic Authentication
Partial example output from GET Call:
Username - The username of the HTTP basic authentication. This user must be a member of the 
DND
Administrators
 group.
Password – The password for HTTP basic authentication.
2
. 
Run a DELETE API call to remove entries from the database.
https://<hostName>/iac-controller/v1/<tenantId>/ terraform/<terraform-state-name>/backend
DELETE Method
Basic Authentication
Username - The username of the HTTP basic authentication. This user must be a member of the 
DND
Administrators
 group.
Password – The password for HTTP basic authentication.
Optional step
Some of the CIs may not show up in the Native SACM UI because they aren't included in the out-of-the-box configuration of
CMS.
If you find that there are discrepancies between the topology in CMS and what's in Native SACM, you can change the out-of-
the-box configuration to add those CIs to be included in ESM. 
1
. 
Log in to the UCMDB UI using the local client or through the browser.
2
. 
Navigate to 
Modeling Studio
 on the left-side navigation.
3
. 
Make sure you are in the Resources view, click 
Resources 
on the top of the screen.
4
. 
In the tree view, expand SMAX Topology and double click 
SMAX_Direct_Linked_CI
.
5
. 
Click the 
Direct_Linked_CI
 Icon in the canvas and click 
Edit
 in the lower right corner.
6
. 
Click the 
Element Type
 view on the top right area.
7
. 
In the tree view on the left side, find the CI Type that you want to add.
