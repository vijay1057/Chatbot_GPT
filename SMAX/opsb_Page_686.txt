Vertica
Hostname
or comma
separated
Hosts
 
Enter the fully qualified domain name or IP address of the external Vertica database server.
Vertica
DB Name
Enter the database name of the external Vertica database server.
Vertica
DB Port
Name
Enter the communications port of the external Vertica database server.
Vertica
DB User
Name and
Password
Enter the user name and password of the DBA user account that you have already created. The suite
will use the Vertica DBA accounts to create databases and database owners for the suite components.
TLS 1.2
If the Vertica database server requires TLS connections, perform the following steps:
1
. 
Select the 
TLS 1.2 
option.
2
. 
Upload your Vertica CA certificate file (in PEM format) to the suite. The CA certificate can be
single-level or multi-level. If multi-level, the CA certificate must include the entire CA certificate
chain (that is, the root CA certificate, second CA certificate, and third CA certificate). To upload
the Vertica CA certificate file, either drag the file from your local drive to the box or browse to the
file.
3
. 
Wait until the file upload is complete.
4
. 
Select an SSL mode from the list:
verify-ca
: the client will verify that the server is trustworthy by checking the certificate
chain up to a trusted certificate authority (CA).
verify-full
: the client will also verify that the server hostname matches the common name
in the server certificate. The SSL connection will fail if the server certificate can't be verified.
This mode is recommended in most security-sensitive environments.
Notes
:
If you don't select the 
TLS 1.2
 option and have configured the Vertica database with SSL, the
suite installation will go through but the CGRO functionality may not work.
By deselecting the 
TLS 1.2
 option, you are disabling or bypassing security features, thereby
exposing the system to increased security risks. By using the non-TLS option, you understand and
agree to assume all associated risks and hold 
Micro Focus
 harmless for the same.
Click 'Test' to validate the connection details. Based on the test result, you will see a corresponding message.
8
. 
On the Suite Admin Settings page, specify an initial password for the following users and then click 
Next
:
suite-admin
: this is the user account used to access the Suite Administration interface.
bo-integration@dummy.com
: This is an integration user of the suite system. This user is used for internal
integration, such as for synchronizing data between tenants and the suite administration interface (which is referred
to as "Suite Administration").
9
. 
A warning is displayed, asking you to confirm if you want to start the installation process. Click 
YES
. The installation
progress is displayed on the screen.
10
. 
The suite installer starts installing the suite services, followed by post-installation actions. When the installer has
completed the post-installation actions, the 
Next
 button becomes active. Click 
Next
. A 
Congratulations
 screen is
displayed. Click 
Finish
. The OMT Management Portal opens. 
Note
: If the screen indicates any of the post-installation
actions fails, see 
Post-installation actions failed
. 
11
. 
Run  the following commands to add annotations and labels to the secret 
nginx-frontend-secret
 and put the secret
under helm management:
kubectl annotate secret nginx-frontend-secret -n ${CDF_NAMESPACE} meta.helm.sh/release-name=apphub
kubectl annotate secret nginx-frontend-secret -n $CDF_NAMESPACE meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=${CDF_NAMESPACE}
kubectl label secret nginx-frontend-secret -n $CDF_NAMESPACE app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=helm
Verify the installation
Perform the following steps.
1
. 
Verify that you can log in to the OMT Management Portal:
https://<EXTERNAL_ACCESS_HOST>:5443 (user name: 
admin
; password: specified during the OMT installation)
Tip
You can log in to a control plane node, and run the 
kubectl get pods --namespace <namespace>
command to check the installation progress in the backend. You can run the 
kubectl get ns
 command to
find the namespace of the suite ("itsma-xxxxx").
