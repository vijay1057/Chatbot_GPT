. 
Log on to the control plane node as root or a sudo user.

. 
Run the following command to remove the OO release:

<OO namespace>
 
is the namespace where you installed OO
3
. 
Go to the 
$CDF_HOME/scripts
 folder and run the following command:
./cdfctl.sh deployment delete -d <OO DEPLOYMENT NAME>
Where, 
<
OO deployment name
>
 is the name you specified for the deployment you created to install OO.
For example:
./cdfctl.sh deployment delete -d oo-prod
Remove persistent volumes
If you created persistent volumes and persistent volume claims based on the 
oo
-pv.yaml
 sample files, run the following
command to delete the volumes and claims:
kubectl delete -f /path/to/oo-pv.yaml
kubectl delete -f /path/to/oo-pvc.yaml
Clean the NFS volumes
Log on to the NFS server host and clear all the contents in the NFS volume directories that you created in the 
Create NFS
volumes 
step.
For example:
rm -rf /var/vols/itom/oo/*
If external databases are used, no need to delete the 
db_volume
.
Clean the databases
The OO uninstallation process doesn't remove the databases from the external PostgreSQL server. You need to remove the
databases manually.
