[INFO] 2020-07-20 20:30:03 : ** Generating the offline image download bundle with suite metadata ...
[INFO] 2020-07-20 20:30:11 : Completed generation of offline-download.zip in /tmp
Download the suite images
1
. 
Log on to the first control plane node. If the first control plane node can't access Docker Hub, transfer the  
offline-download.z
ip
  file to a Linux server that can access Docker Hub.
2
. 
Extract the .zip package to a directory. If you can't access Docker Hub directly, run the following commands to set up the
HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Replace the placeholders with your actual server and port. 
export http_proxy="<http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
export https_proxy="<https://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
3
. 
Go to the directory you extracted the 
offline-download.zip
 package into.
4
. 
Run the following command:
./downloadimages.sh -r <image repository URL> -u <username> -d <image download directory> -c on|off -o <org name>
In this command:
<image repository URL>
 specifies the image repository if you aren't using Docker Hub.
<username>
 specifies the Docker Hub username. If you don't specify the credentials here, the
downloadimages.sh
 script will prompt you to enter them when you run the command.
<image download directory>
 specifies the directory to which the 
downloadimages.sh 
script saves the container images.
The default value is 
/var/opt/cdf/offline
.
The 
-c
 option specifies whether the 
downloadimages.sh
 script verifies the digital signature of the images during the
download. The default setting is 
off
 (the script doesn't verify the signature).
<org name>
 specifies the organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. The default
value is 
hpeswitom.
 This option is mandatory if you aren't using the default organization name.
The 
downloadimages.sh
 script also has a 
-p
 option that specifies your password. The 
-p
  option doesn't support single
quotes (don't include single quotes in the password).
Transfer the images to the control plane node
If you downloaded the images to a location other than the first control plane node, you must transfer the images to a directory
on the first control plane node. You will later use the 
uploadimages.sh
 script to upload the images from this directory on the first
control plane node to the image registry.
The default directory is 
/var/opt/cdf/offline
. If you don't save the images to this directory, you must use the 
-d
 option to
specify the location when you later run the 
uploadimages.sh
 script.
The image upload process requires disc capacity at least twice the size of the images. Make sure that the capacity of the
directory where you save the images is at least twice the size of the images.
