This document means to aid customers who want to utilize SAM within SMAX. It details how to navigate SAM, generate
software licenses, create metrics, and show how they can be consumed to create compliance & analysis reports. The key
entities discussed in this document are; Products, License Models, Licenses, Compliance & Analysis. License Metrics and
License Rules have also been added for completeness.
The information in this document assumes that SAM has already been setup and installed. If this is not the case, see the

Overview and Navigation of SAM

Run
 and then click on 
Software Asset.
In order to view and use SAM, an Agent must be granted the appropriate permissions. They need View rights for the License
record type in order to see the SAM Home and Compliance screens. For access to all additional functionality, Admin rights for
the License record type are needed.
If the agent has full admin rights, they should be brought to the SAM Home screen:
