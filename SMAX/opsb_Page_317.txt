  "Upn": "MyLoginId",
   "Email":"MyNewUser@microfocus.com",

   "IsMaasUser":"false",  
   "OfficePhoneNumber":"867-5309",
   "EmployeeNumber": "4815162342"
  }
 }]

Updating a Contact
To update a contact using the Manage Person API, simply create a REST payload with the desired attributes that also includes

{
"operation": "CREATE_OR_UPDATE",
 "users": [{
  "properties": {
   "Upn": "MyNewUser@microfocus.com",
   "IsMaasUser":"false", 
   "EmployeeNumber": "45555555"
  }
