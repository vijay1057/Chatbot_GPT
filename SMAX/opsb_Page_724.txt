Create a deployment for CMS
You can use the tool provided by OMT to create a deployment, which gets a namespace, default certificate, and service
account prepared for installing an application by Helm charts.
1
. 
Log on to the first control plane as a root user. If you want to install OMT as sudo user, follow the instructions in "Configure
sudo access" to give the user related installation permissions first and then perform the following steps.
2
. 
Run the following commands to create an ITOM application deployment.
cd $CDF_HOME/scripts
./cdfctl.sh deployment create -d 
<CMS DEPLOYMENT NAME>
 [-n 
<CMS NAMESPACE>
]
For example:
cd $CDF_HOME/scripts
./cdfctl.sh deployment create -d cms-prod
The 
-n
 option is optional. If you do not specify this option, the value defaults to the deployment name (the value of the 
-
d
 option). You can run the 
./cdfctl.sh deployment -h
 command to view other options.
When the application deployment is successful, "Successfully created deployment 
<name>
" is printed to the console.
(Optional) Create custom certificates
Log in to the first control plane node as a root user or non-root user. Then, perform the following steps to use the external
certificates:
1
. 
Upload the custom certificates and key to a directory on the first control plane node. For example: 
/tmp/ca.crt
, 
/tmp/server.cr
t
, and 
/tmp/server.key
.
The supported certificate format is 
.pem
 (base-64 encoded)
If the certificate is signed by a multiple level certificate authority, the CA cert file should be concatenated with the
following order: 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<intermediate-level-1>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<intermediate-level-2>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<intermediate-level-n>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<root.crt>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
There are no empty line between certificates
2
. 
Run the following commands to check the custom certificates:
$CDF_HOME/scripts/certCheck -ca <CA cert directory>/<CA cert file> -cert <cert file directory>/<cert file> -key <private key directory>/<private key> -host <external access hostname> 
For example:
$CDF_HOME/scripts/certCheck -ca /tmp/ca.crt -cert /tmp/server.crt -key /tmp/server.key  -host fqdn1.example.com
Where:
The 
<CA cert directory>/<CA cert file>
  is your CA certificate file in the absolute path format.
The 
<cert file directory>/<cert file>
 is your server certificate in the absolute path format.
The 
<private key directory>/<private key>
 is your private key in the absolute path format.
The 
certCheck
 script checks the following: 
Whether the certificates and key files are well-encoded in PEM.
Whether the certificates match with the private key file.
Whether the certificates have been expired.
Whether the certificates have been revoked basing on a CRL distribution point.
Whether the certificate subject common name or SAN name matches with its FQDN.
If your terminal resembles the following, you have passed the certificate checking.
[root@sh ~]# $CDF_HOME/scripts/certCheck -ca /tmp/ca.crt -cert /tmp/server.crt -key /tmp/server.key -host fqdn1.example.com
success
