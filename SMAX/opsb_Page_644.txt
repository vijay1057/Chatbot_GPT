(Optional) Start to download the suite images
This step is optional.
Later in the installation process, you will use the Installation Portal to download the suite images from the image registry, and
then import them to a local registry. If these images are large, the process may take a long time. You can therefore choose to
start the download process now. If you do so, you can later ignore the 
Download the images
 section on the 
Download the
container images
 page of the Installation Portal.
You don't need to do this when you install OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) and the suite with an external image registry (set
by using the 
--registry-url 
option of the 
install 
command). If you set the 
--registry-url 
option, the 
install
 command downloads and
uploads all required images automatically.
Generate the download bundle
1
. 
Log on to the first control plane node (where you saved the installation package).
2
. 
Run the following command to change directory. Replace 
<OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx-xxx>
 with the installation package
name.
cd /<OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx-xxx>>/tools/generate-download
3
. 
Run the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 command together with the options required by your deployment. For example, run
the following command to generate from metadata file. Replace all the placeholders with the actual values.
./generate_download_bundle.sh -m <suite metadata> -s <suite name> -v <suite version> -o hpeswitom -d <offline-download.zip location>
For more examples, refer to the script usage. 
For example:
./generate_download_bundle.sh -m /directory/containing/suite-metadata.tgz -s itsma -v 202x.xx -o hpeswitom -d /tmp
In this example, the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 script saves the 
offline-download.zip
 in the 
/tmp
 directory.

If you receive messages that resemble the following, you have successfully generated the 
offline-download.zip
 file:
Note
CA certificate verification is required between the registry server and its authentication server when downloading
and uploading images. If you didn't load the registry CA certificate into the truststore of your download or upload
machine, the download and upload process might fail.
To add a registry CA certificate into the truststore, refer to the following example. We take CentOS as an example,
for other OS, refer its official documentation.
1
. 
Copy the registry CA certificate to the folder: 
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
2
. 
Run the following command to update the registry CA certificate to truststore:
update-ca-trust extract

Note:
 To follow the steps in this section, you must have installed the 
zip
 Linux command on the node where you
run the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 script.
Note:
In case of low performance, you can add 
-S|--skip-image-check
 to skip calculating the image delta and improve
the performance. However, it might result in generating redundant images.
