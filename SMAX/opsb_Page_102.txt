Apply the OO Containerized 2022.11.P2 patch
Upgrading to the 2022.11.P2 patch consists of three stages:
Pre-upgrade hooks
: There are three Kubernetes jobs that run first. These are responsible for upgrading the databases
of the OO components and tailoring some IDM resources. If these jobs run successfully, the upgrade process continues
with rolling out the new version of OO pods. 
If these jobs fail, the upgrade process stops.
Rolling update
: This is the stage where the OO pods are upgraded to the new version through the rolling update
strategy. 
Post upgrade
: A Kubernetes job runs as soon as the pre-upgrade hooks are complete and waits until all the OO
components are rolled out to the new version before it runs. Its purpose is to upgrade all OO RAS pods in the OO
namespace in sequential order. This step takes time, about 5 minutes per RAS.
 To install the 2022.11.P2 patch, follow these steps:
1
. 
Run the following command: 
helm upgrade <oo_install_name> -n <oo_namespace> <OO chart file> -f <previous_deployment_values.yaml> --set global.deploymentType="upgrade" --timeout 30m
Where:
<
oo_install_name
> is the name of the OO deployment that you specified when installing OO 2022.11
<
oo_namespace
> is the unique namespace of the OO deployment.
<
OO_chart_file
> is the new tar file containing the OO installation charts.
<
previous_deployment_values.yaml
> is an absolute path of 
previous_deployment_values.yaml
 file, obtained through the 
helm get v
alues
 command.
For example:
helm upgrade oo -n oo oo-1.0.x+2022xx01P2-xx/oo-helm-charts/charts/oo-1.0.x+2022xx01P2.xx.tgz -f <previous_deployment_values.yaml> --set global.deploymentType="upgrade" --timeout 30m
You can run this command with the 
--dry-run
 argument to simulate an upgrade.
On successful completion of pre-upgrade hooks, you will see a message similar to the following. Completing pre-upgrade
hooks takes about 3 to 4 minutes.
    
Release "<oo_install_name>" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
