. 
Select 
Managed NFS

File System Type

Launch EFS
).
III
. 
Enter the Exported Paths of EFS volumes using the 
/<base directory>/<volume label on the web UI>
 format. For
example, if you provide the <base directory> as 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/
 and the current volume's display label
shows 
db-backup-vol
, the exported path should be 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/db-backup-vol
.
b
. 
Although you can repeat the steps above to manually configure the rest of the NFS volumes, we recommend using
the

are located in the same parent folder (<base directory>)
