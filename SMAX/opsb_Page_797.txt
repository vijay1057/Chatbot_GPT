Sizing considerations for EKS deployment
The performance information provided here is based on tests in an out-of-box environment and for your reference only. Your
implementation may consume more resources or require more resources to perform in an acceptable manner.
SMA size definitions
When you run the suite installer, you will need to select a suite size: 
Small
, 
Medium
, or 
Large
. Different suite sizes require
different hardware configurations. 
The following table describes the available suite sizes.

agent users)

400~1000
1000~3000
Concurrent users are active users who have logged in to the system
to perform operations and consume system resources. There are
two types of concurrent users, service portal users and IT agent
users. The workload for each user type is defined as:
For service portal users: After logging in to the system, each
portal user has about 30-minute session duration on the
system and will create 1 ~ 2 orders or requests.
For IT agent users: IT agent users have longer session
duration, and each of them will be active for about 1.5 hours
after logon and handle 4 ~ 6 tickets.
Based on this workload assumption, the business operation
throughput can be calculated. For example, for 400 service portal
users, the number of newly created orders or requests will be 800
~ 1600 per hour, while for 400 IT agent users, the number of
handled tickets will be 1000 ~ 1600 per hour. If you have a much
larger business operation throughput than the numbers provided
here, consider adding more worker nodes.
Notes:
The sizing numbers are based on an assumption that there are only
standard SMA tenant users. If you are using one or more Service
Manager tenants or using both SMA and Service Manager tenants,
user count conversion is needed.
In general, 1 Service Manager user = 0.7 standard SMA users,
because a Service Manager tenant consumes only Service Portal in
the container when SMA is integrated with external Service
Manager.
For example, if an SMA deployment needs to support 400 Service
Manager tenant concurrent users and 100 SMA tenant concurrent
users, the actual user count is 400 X 0.7 + 100 = 380. So you need
to select the Small size.

Hardware requirements for SMA (SMA only)
The following table lists the minimum resources needed for setting up an SMA environment in the cloud with high availability.
A standard deployment includes control plane nodes (owned by AWS), worker nodes, EFS as storage, and RDS as databases.
