Configure the product
In this step, you need to configure the product with information such as the license rules used to count product licenses and
the product compatibility matrix that allows you to define the downgrade and upgrade paths.
Maintain license compatibility matrix
The compatibility matrix feature built in SAM offers you the capability to downgrade or upgrade the license for a product. The
downgrade matrix allows a license to cover the installations of lower-version products. In addition, if you’ve used up the
licenses for a product version, you can use the upgrade matrix to recalculate the number of the higher-version licenses needed
for covering the product installations and then buy the corresponding number of licenses to stay compliant.

tab, hover over 
Visio 2019 Pro
, press and hold down the left mouse button, and then draw a line
between it and Visio 2016 Pro. This indicates that the licenses for Visio 2019 Pro can be downgraded to entitle the use of
Visio 2016 Pro.
In the 
Upgrade 
tab, draw a line between the Visio 2019 Pro and Visio 2016 Pro. After you set the upgrade relationship,
once the licenses for Visio 2016 Pro are used up, SAM will recalculate the number of extra licenses you need to purchase
for entitling Visio 2019 Pro. This helps bring you back to compliance.
