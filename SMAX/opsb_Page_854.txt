Replace the following with the actual values:
<application_loadbalancer_name>
: the group name for the ALB to be created.
<certificate_arn>
: the
 resource name
 of the prepared certificate. For
example, 
arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
.
<external_access_host>
: the FQDN you've allocated for the suite. For example, 
www.example.com
.

. 
Run the following command to apply the saved YAML file:
kubectl create -f installation-portal-ingress.yaml
To check the ingress status, run the command below.
kubectl get ingress -n core cdf-mngm-ingress 
The output should be as below and should contain the 
elb
 address.
NAME             CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS         PORTS     AGE
install-ingress    <none>
   *         xxx.xxx.elb.amazonaws.com   80, 443   147m 
Now an ALB is created and the Ingress for port 3000 is bound to this ALB automatically.
Bind FQDN with Application Load Balancer
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. In this installation
procedure example, Amazon Route 53 is used to bind an FQDN (<external_access_host>) such as www.example.com to
ALB so that end users can easily access the suite from web browsers.

. 
Save the following file as 
createRecord.json
:
{
Important 
 The ALB group name must begin and end with an alphanumeric character, should contain
no space and can contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens. For example, 
main-alb
. You need to
use the same value when you create Ingress resources for port 5443 and port 443 later.

Note
:  If the above command fails to get the elb address, use the commands below to troubleshoot. You
can then refer to 
AWS load balancer troubleshooting page
 and visit 
error recreating load balancer
 for possible
solutions.
kubectl describe ingress -n core install-ingress 
kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment.apps/aws-load-balancer-controller

Note  
Amazon Route 53 isn't the only option. If your domain name isn't provided by Route 53, you may
contact your domain name provider to bind the domain name to the Application Load Balancer DNS name.
