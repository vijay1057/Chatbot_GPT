Using Flannel with Containerd
The Containerd daemon assigns DHCP IP addresses for the containers on this node from its assigned network CIDR.
Kubernetes records this container IP address and stores the information in Etcd and decorates the pause container with the
network information.
IP address allocation has two exceptions:
Case 1: containers that share the host IP address:
Kubernetes Pods started with “hostNetwork: true”: Kubernetes API server, Kubernetes controller manager, Kube Proxy,
Kube Scheduler, Keepalived
Case 2: Kubernetes Services (Kind:Service): assigned from a network defined when the Kubernetes API server is started. This
doesn't overlap with any Pod IPs.
# kubectl describe svc mng-portal -n core
Name: mng-portal
Namespace: core
Labels: app=mng-portal
Annotations: <none>
Selector: app=mng-portal
Type: ClusterIP
IP: 172.17.17.117
Port: <unset> 80/TCP
TargetPort: 9090/TCP
Endpoints: 172.16.98.2:9090
Session Affinity: None
Events: <none>
The cluster services IP address is specified on the Kubernetes API server:
…..
- command:
- /hyperkube
- apiserver
- --bind-address=0.0.0.0
- --etcd-servers=https://hostname.mycompany.net:4001
- --insecure-port=0
- --secure-port=8443
- --service-cluster-ip-range=172.17.17.0/24
…..
All other OMT AppHub containers have an IP addresses assigned by the Containerd daemon from the network defined by
Flannel.
The following diagram shows a practical example:
The host node has a statically assigned IP address from 16.0.0.0/16
The Containerd daemon is only accessible via localhost and has a container subnet selected from 172.16.0.0/16. The
actual subnet will be selected by Flannel for this node.
Kubernetes Kubelet runs directly on the node and shares the host’s IP address.
Various other Kubernetes components run containerized but share the host’s IP address (*).
All other OMT AppHub and Suite components run containerized and get an IP addressed assigned in the 172.16.0.0/16
Flannel selected subnet (*2).

The Pod is decorated with the DHCP IP address in the local node subnet address range.
All containers that make up the Pod share the same IP address. Inside the Pod, containers can talk to each other’s processes
using “localhost”.
