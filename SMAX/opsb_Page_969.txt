Configure EFS for Audit service
This section describes how to create and configure Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) to store Audit data on AWS, as well as
how to configure EFS volumes for Audit service. Audit will be using the same EFS as SMAX.
Prepare EFS template for Audit
The following section gives the steps to prepare an EFS template for Audit. You may come across a "Permission denied"
message if you have insufficient permissions while executing the following commands. Run the following commands again by
adding sudo at the beginning of the commands:
1
. 
Create an EFS directory for Audit by running the following command:
mkdir -p <mount path>/var/vols/itom/audit/<Audit Namespace>/vault
mkdir -p <mount path>/var/vols/itom/audit/<Audit Namespace>/log
For example,
mkdir -p /efs/var/vols/itom/audit/auditns/vault
mkdir -p /efs/var/vols/itom/audit/auditns/log
2
. 
Change the permission for the directory that you have created by running the following command:
chmod g+ws <mount path>/var/vols/itom/audit/<Audit Namespace>/vault
chmod g+ws <mount path>/var/vols/itom/audit/<Audit Namespace>/log
For example,
chmod g+ws /efs/var/vols/itom/audit/auditns/vault
chmod g+ws /efs/var/vols/itom/audit/auditns/log
3
. 
Change the owner of the directory you have created by running the following command:
chown 
<SYSTEM_USER_ID>
:
<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID> 
<mount path>/var/vols/itom/audit/<Audit Namespace>/vault
chown 
<SYSTEM_USER_ID>
:
<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID> 
<mount path>/var/vols/itom/audit/<Audit Namespace>/log
For example,
chown 1999:1999 /efs/var/vols/itom/audit/auditns/vault
chown 1999:1999 /efs/var/vols/itom/audit/auditns/log

You require the following EFS volumes for the Audit deployment. Make sure the exported EFS volumes are empty and have no
data.
