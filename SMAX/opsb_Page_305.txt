Configuring Postman
Introduction
Service Management Automation X allows users to access and modify data using a REST API. In order to use the REST API a
REST tool needs to be configured. A commonly used tool available is Postman.
This chapter will cover:
Installing Postman
Creating a Workspace and Collection
Sending and receiving back the login token
Sending a REST command to create an entity using the EMS API
Sending a REST command to get an entity using the EMS API
Installing Postman
Postman is a free application available on the Postman website. The instructions below are for the downloaded application and
not the web version of the utility. To download access 
https://www.postman.com/downloads/
 and select the Windows 64-bit
download.
Double click on the Postman-win64-<version>.exe to launch the installation.
Creating a Workspace and Collection
On first launch, Postman will require a user to create a login and password. After logging in, add a new workspace that will
contain all the REST collections.
After selecting the Workspace, add a new Collection so that the REST configurations can be saved and reused.
Once the collection has been created, the “add a request” option becomes available.
