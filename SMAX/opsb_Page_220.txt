Release Flow
Classification
When creating a release, the release coordinator must supply all of the relevant details. This includes filling out the
following fields during the 'Log' phase:
Title - A short description of the Release
Release type - Whether this is a minor, major, or emergency release
Description - A detailed description of the release
Service - What service is driving the release (the release might affect multiple services, but this specifies which one
is the primary reason the release was required)
Release model - What pre-defined model will this release follow
Reason for release - Why the release is necessary (selected from a list of reasons)
Justification - A detailed explanation of why this release is necessary
The release coordinator may also specify the latest execution date necessary for the release, categorize it, and set the
urgency.
In the next phase, 'Evaluate', the release coordinator can review the previous information and then must categorize the
release and assign it to an owning group and owner. This is also where the release coordinator identifies the necessary
changes and ensures they are part of the release by creating or linking them.
Once the release coordinator specifies this information, they can move the release forward into the 'Planning' step.
Release Flow
Each release is governed by the release management workflow.
This workflow defines the activities that happen before and after the actual changes that make up the release are
implemented and determines what happens if the changes aren't successful.
