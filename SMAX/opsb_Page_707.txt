Upload container images for CMS to a registry
Upload the installation images to your image registry. The image registry is a local registry on your cluster nodes or an
external registry, such as your enterprise repository.
To upload the images:
1
. 
Log on to the control plane node where you downloaded or copied the images.
2
. 
Run the following command to the 
$CDF_HOME/scripts/
 directory:
cd $CDF_HOME/scripts
3
. 
Run the following command to upload the suite images to the local registry:
./uploadimages.sh [-r <image repository URL> -u <username> -d <image download directory> -o <org name>]
Where:
<image repository URL>: Specify the 
-r
 option if you want to upload the images to an external registry other than
the local registry.
Replace <
username
> with the registry username.  Use the 
registry-admin
 user for the local registry. The local registry
refers to the default registry or the registry URL that's 
localhost:5000
.
If you don't specify the credentials here, the 
./uploadimages.sh
 script prompts you to specify them when you run the
command.
<image download directory>: The directory where the script downloads the container images. The default value is
/var/opt/cdf/offline. The 
-d
 option is the image directory where you placed the downloaded images. Specify the 
-d
option if the images aren't available in the 
/var/opt/cdf/offline/
 directory. You can use the 
-d
 option multiple times when
the images are in different directories. The images can be the images downloaded by the 
downloadimages.sh
 or saved
by 
docker save
. For images saved by 
docker save
, only 
.tar
, 
.tgz
, and 
.tar.gz
 images are supported. Make sure the
image file type matches the file extension. 
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, this is 
hpeswit
om.
 This option is mandatory if you aren't using the default organization name.
To see the full list of options for the 
uploadimages.sh
 command, run the following command:
./uploadimages.sh -h 
For example: 
./uploadimages.sh -y -c 4 -u registry-admin
The 
-p
 option is the password of the 
registry-admin
 user . The initial value of the 
registry-admin
 user password is the
password you set while you run the 
install
 to install OMT. You can also change the 
registry-admin
 user password with the
script 
$CDF_HOME/scripts/updateLocalRegistryInfo.sh
.
4
. 
Wait until the images are successfully uploaded. Your terminal resembles the following:
Upload-process successfully completed.
Note: 
CA certificate verification is required between the registry server and its authentication server when
downloading and uploading images. If you didn't load the registry CA certificate into the truststore of your
download or upload machine, the download and upload process might fail.
To add a registry CA certificate into the truststore, refer to the following example, which uses CentOS. For other
operating systems, refer the official documentation.
1
. 
Copy the registry CA certificate to the folder: 
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
2
. 
Run the following command to update the registry CA certificate to truststore:
update-ca-trust extract
