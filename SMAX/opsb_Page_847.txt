Step 3: Create an Ingress for the installation portal
Create an Ingress for port 3000 with these steps:
1
. 
Save the content below as 
installation-portal-ingress.yaml
:
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: "install-ingress"
  namespace: "core"
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: <application_loadbalancer_name>
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTPS": 3000}]'
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-protocol: HTTPS
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-port: traffic-port
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/success-codes: 200-399
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: instance
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: <certificate_arn>
  labels:
    app: install-ingress
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <external_access_host>
  rules:
    - host:
      http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              service:
                name: "frontend-ingress-controller-svc"
                port: 
                  number: 3000
            path: /*
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
Replace the following with the actual values:
<application_loadbalancer_name>
: the name of the ALB to be created.
<certificate_arn>
: the
 resource name
 of the prepared certificate. For
example, 
arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
.
Important 
 The name must consist of 
lower case
 alphanumeric characters, '-', or '.', and must start
and end with an alphanumeric character. You need to use the same value when you create Ingress
resources for port 5443 and port 443 later.
