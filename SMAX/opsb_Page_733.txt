Uninstall CMS
To uninstall CMS, perform the following tasks:
Delete the CMS deployment
1
. 
Log on to the control plane node as root or a sudo user.
2
. 
Run the following command to remove the CMS release:
helm uninstall <
CMS RELEASE NAME
> -n <
CMS NAMESPACE
>
Where:
<
CMS RELEASE NAME
>
 is the CMS release that you want to uninstall
<CMS NAMESPACE>
 
is the namespace where you installed CMS
3
. 
Go to the 
$CDF_HOME/scripts
 folder and run the following command:
./cdfctl.sh deployment delete -d <
CMS DEPLOYMENT NAME
>
Where:
<
CMS DEPLOYMENT NAME
>
 is the name you specified for the deployment you created to install CMS.
For example:
./cdfctl.sh deployment delete -d cms-prod
Remove persistent volumes
If you created PVs based on the 
cms-pv.yaml
 sample file as documented in 
Create persistent volumes
, you can run the
following command to delete the persistent volumes:
kubectl delete -f cms-pv.yaml
Clean the NFS volumes
Log on to the NFS server host and clear all the contents in the NFS volume directories that you created in the 
Create NFS
volumes 
step.
For example:
rm -rf /var/vols/itom/cms/data_volume/*
rm -rf /var/vols/itom/cms/conf_volume/*
rm -rf /var/vols/itom/cms/log_volume/*
rm -rf /var/vols/itom/cms/db_volume/*
Clean the databases
The CMS un-installation process does not remove the databases from the external PostgreSQL server. You need to remove the
databases manually.
Note 
 If external databases are used, no need to delete the db_volume.
