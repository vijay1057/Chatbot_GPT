The highlighted line above shows that only Physical devices were taken into account. If the Agent knew more devices had this
product installed but was wondering why only 7 were showing in the compliance report, this explains why. Currently in order
for VMs to appear in the calculation all the physical kit that hosts the VMs would need to be discovered as well. A VM with no
physical kit associated to it, would not be considered for calculation within the Generic per Device rule that was used for doing
the worked example above. The rule specifically looks at the Host is Virtual attribute in UCMDB to determine if it should be
used within the calculation.
