Install and configure Keepalived on both HAProxy hosts
If you use a hardware load balancer instead of Keepalived, skip this step and perform the "Configure a hardware load
balancer" step instead. 
1
. 
Turn off SELinux.
a
. 
Modify the file "/etc/selinux/config", by changing "SELINUX=enforcing" to "SELINUX=disabled".
b
. 
Run the following command:
#setenforce 0
2
. 
Get the network interface name. In this section, we will use "eth0" as an example. You need to replace it with yours in the
next steps.
ifconfig -a|grep "UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST"|awk '{print $1}'
3
. 
Configure the firewall on both HAProxy hosts.
a
. 
Back up the file "/etc/firewalld/direct.xml" if it exists.
b
. 
Add direct rules by running the following commands or by modifying 
/etc/firewalld/direct.xml
:
#firewall-cmd --direct --permanent --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 --in-interface 
eth0
 
--destination 224.0.0.18 --protocol vrrp -j ACCEPT
#firewall-cmd --direct --permanent --add-rule ipv4 filter OUTPUT 0 --out-interface 
eth0 
--destination 224.0.0.18 --protocol vrrp -j ACCEPT
#firewall-cmd --reload
Note:
 This step will write the rules to the /etc/firewalld/direct.xml file. If you receive an error at this step, please go
to the /etc/firewalld/direct.xml file to modify it and run "firewall-cmd --reload" to make it take effect. Here is an
example:
#cat 
/etc/firewalld/direct.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<direct>
  <rule ipv="ipv4" table="filter" chain="INPUT" priority="0"> --in-interface eth0 --destination 224.0.0.18 --protocol vrrp -j ACCEPT</rule>
  <rule ipv="ipv4" table="filter" chain="OUTPUT" priority="0"> --out-interface eth0 --destination 224.0.0.18 --protocol vrrp -j ACCEPT</rule>
</direct>
c
. 
Run the following command to make sure the rules above are added:
#firewall-cmd --direct --get-rules ipv4 filter OUTPUT
#firewall-cmd --direct --get-rules ipv4 filter INPUT
4
. 
Install and configure Keepalived on both hosts.
a
. 
On the haproxy1 host, running the following commands:
#yum install keepalived -y
#cat /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
global_defs {
  router_id gd_ha01
  default_interface eth0
}
vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
  script "killall -0 haproxy"
