This step includes the following tasks required in production environments for optimized system performance while avoiding
useless overhead.
Update OS TCP socket read/write buffer size and port range
Check the OS settings on the TCP socket read/write buffer with the 
sysctl
 utility. In most situations, you need to increase
them. To do this, follow these steps:
1
. 
Open the 
/etc/sysctl.conf
 file, and add the following settings:
net.core.wmem_max=4194304
net.core.rmem_max=4194304
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem=4096 87380 4194304
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem=4096 87380 4194304
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32768 65535
2
. 
When the deployment size is 
medium
 or 
large
, to avoid lots of 
TIME_WAIT
 TCP socket connections, which may produce
502/504 errors in the front end, you may need to further tune TCP socket behaviors from the OS level to reuse the
TIME_WAIT
 socket. To do this, add the following line to the 
/etc/sysctl.conf
 file:
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1
3
. 
Run the 
/sbin/sysctl -p
 command to make your settings take effect.
Increase OS resource limits
Perform the following steps to increase the default "open files" and "max user processes" values for the user whose user ID
and group ID are the 
SYSTEM_USER_ID
 and 
SYSTEM_GROUP_ID
 parameter values defined in the install.properties file of
OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) (both parameters have a default value of 1999).  Note that the following command lines use
their default value of 1999 for example.
Caution
: this task is mandatory to ensure the suite system stability.
To increase the OS resource limits, follow these steps:
1
. 
Run the 
ulimit -a
 command to check the OS resources.
2
. 
Open the 
/etc/security/limits.conf
 file:
vi /etc/security/limits.conf
3
. 
Make sure you configure the following lines:
* hard nofile 1000000
* soft nofile 1000000
root hard nofile 1000000
root soft nofile 1000000
* soft nproc 1000000
* hard nproc 1000000
4
. 
Add a group (GID=<
SYSTEM_GROUP_ID
>) and user (UID=<
SYSTEM_USER_ID
>): 
groupadd -g 1999 itsma
useradd -g 1999 -u 1999 itsma
Skip this step if the GID and UID already exist.
5
. 
Add two lines for the 
itsma
 user (If your system uses another user name for <
SYSTEM_USER_ID
>, change 
itsma
 to
your own user name):
* hard nofile 1000000
* soft nofile 1000000
root hard nofile 1000000
root soft nofile 1000000
itsma hard nofile 1000000
itsma soft nofile 1000000
* soft nproc 1000000
* hard nproc 1000000
Update the operating system's default 
nproc
 values
