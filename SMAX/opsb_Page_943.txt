These parameters define how the OO application reaches the context of the entire SMAX suite.  
Parameter
Required
Description
Default
Example
global.externalA
ccessHost
Yes
This is the external access point for OO, and the FQDN
should be in the following format: 
oo.<suite-fqdn>
.
The FQDN specified at this parameter is also the DNS
name of the OO Application Load Balancer (ALB) for
external access, which you'll create later. See
Configure load balancers for OO
 for details on the
external access ALB.
N/A
If you can access the suite
using the
FQDN  
smax.example.com
,
then you can access OO
using 
oo
.smax.example.com.
global.externalA
ccessPort
Yes
This is the port number on which you can access OO
from outside of the Kubernetes cluster. 
The port number specified here is the listener port of
the OO ALB for external access, which you'll create
later. See 
Configure load balancers for OO
 for details
on the external access ALB.
9443
443
global.nginx.http
sPort
Yes
This is the https port on which the OO deployed Nginx
controller listens and routes the traffic to the OO pods
via ingress rules.
Set this value to 
443
.
If the parameter isn't set, it will take the value of the
global.externalAccessPort
 parameter.
9443
443
global.setFqdnInI
ngress
Yes
This parameter controls whether the ingress rules for
OO components apply for a single host, specified using
the 
global.externalAccessHost
, or not. 
In EKS, traffic towards the OO components comes from
two different sources: from the public Application Load
Balancer for OO, and the integration Application Load
Balancer. 
Therefore, you must set this parameter to 
false.
