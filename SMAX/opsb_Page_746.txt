Prepare external database for OO
To prepare the PostgreSQL database for Operations Orchestration Containerized (OO Containerized), perform the following
tasks:
Install the PostgreSQL database
You can use a PostgreSQL database server for OO Containerized. Please see the PostgreSQL documentation for installation
details. 
It's strongly recommended to host the database server on a 
physical machine
, and it should be an independent server
without other applications running on it.
If the database server machine is a virtual machine, you must have a dedicated resource as a database server.
Set the database servers to the same time zone, daylight savings settings, and time as the OO servers.
Install OO in the same LAN as the database servers (without a proxy and firewalls between them). Otherwise, your
system's performance may get impacted.
Set the machine's system resources where you install PostgreSQL database according to the on-premises deployment
sizing guide.
Configure the database server

(Optional) Enable TLS connections for the database server. For details, see 
Enable TLS connections to external
PostgreSQL
.
Both SSL modes (
verify-full
 and 
verify-ca
) are supported. For details, see the PostgreSQL documentation.

. 
In the 
postgresql.conf
 file, configure the following parameters: 
Parameter
Value
effective_cache_size
7.5 GB
maintenance_work_mem
256 MB
max_connections
1400
shared_buffers
4.5 GB
work_mem
300 MB
listen_addresses
'*'
The default value of the 
listen_addresses
 parameter is "
localhost
", which means only localhost can connect to the
PostgreSQL instance. Set 
listen_addresses = '*'
 to allow remote connections.
If you share the database server with other suite components, make sure to add the OO database configuration
requirements to the suite's database configuration options.

. 
Configure encoding and locale. Make sure that the PostgreSQL instance uses the following encoding and locale settings:
Encoding: UTF8
LC_COLLATE: en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE: en_US.UTF-8
Create OO database users and database names
In the OO application, the following components require databases:
OO Central
OO UI
OO Controller
OO Scheduler
AutoPass License Service (AutoPass)
In the production environment, you must use external databases for the OO application. Enter the database users and
database names during OO installation using the Helm parameters. 
The databases must be empty so that OO will initialize them during installation. The table below shows example database
information prepared for the following components:
Service
Database User
Database Name
Schema 
OO Central
oocentraldbuser
oocentraldb
oo_cen_core
OO UI
oouidbuser
oouidb
public
OO Controller
oocontrollerdbuser
oocontrollerdb
public
OO Scheduler
ooschedulerdbuser
ooschedulerdb
oo_sch_core
AutoPass
aplsdbuser
aplsdb
public
Below are sample SQL commands for creating a user and a database for a service for the PostgreSQL database:
