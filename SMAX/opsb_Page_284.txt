Downloading the Data
Run the REST call https://<FarmName>/rest/<tenantId>/bi/status/<syncId> in order to see if the Job has completed.
The result of the REST call will include "Status": "COMPLETE", if the job has completed. When complete there will be a “files”
section that lists all of the Ids of the files that were created during the export. There may be multiple files for a specific entity
type depending on the number of records exported. The files are compressed in Zip format. You will need to download all of
these files. In some situations creating an automated script may be the most efficient means of downloading all files.
Files are named in the format "FileId": "4743431f-6c4b-4f24-87b8-bfe15721da97". To download the file from the browser,
ensure you are currently logged into the Service Management Automation X system, then type the following URL into the
browser: https:/<FarmName>/rest/<tenantId>/frs/file-list/<FileID>
