Additional hardware requirements for DND and OO
Use the following table to determine your DND and OO deployment size. 
To set up OO with a common database, you can choose to connect OO to the same database instance as the rest of the suite
components. For hardware requirements, see the table 
Standard hardware requirements with a common database.

Additional hardware requirements for CMS
If using a classic CMS
If you plan to use classic CMS, install CMS Gateway on the UCMDB Server, and add the following minimal resources for CMS
Gateway (for classic CMS hardware resource requirements, see 
Classic CMS sizing recommendations
):
Deployment
CPU
RAM
Disk Space
All sizes
4 cores
2 GB (allocated for CMS Gateway only)
100 GB
If using the containerized CMS
Note
: 
You can configure a dedicated database server for OO. Using a physical database server for the OO
application helps in achieving optimal performance. For hardware requirements, see 
Additional hardware
requirements for OO Containerized
 above.
