Check the host names and set up hostname resolutions

You must check the host names of all nodes.
If you have configured Domain Name Service (DNS) in your environment, and the control plane and worker nodes can resolve
the FQDN of all cluster nodes, load balancer host, NFS server, and external databases, then you may skip the "Configure the
hosts file in the etc directory" section on this page. If you use 
/etc/hosts
 based name resolution in your environment, you
should follow the whole topic.
Check the host name
During OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) installation, the host names of all nodes are required for the deployment
configuration and therefore will be checked for their correctness. You must make sure that you are using the correct host
names for the installation. OMT only supports the static host names for the installation.
Perform the following steps to check the static host name of a node.
1
. 
Log in to a cluster node.
2
. 
Run the following command on a node to check its static host name:
hostnamectl
Your terminal resembles the following:
[root@sh ~]#  hostnamectl
   Static hostname: myhost.mycompany.com
         Icon name: computer-vm
           Chassis: vm
        Machine ID: af14ee79777240d18656470df5644663
           Boot ID: 408dfd7f52554719b90c722ffc948f52
    Virtualization: vmware
  Operating System: CentOS Linux 7 (Core)
       CPE OS Name: cpe:/o:centos:centos:7
            Kernel: Linux 3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64
      Architecture: x86-64
3
. 
If the present static host name isn't the expected one, you can set it to a particular value. Run the following command on
the node to set a particular host name. Replace the <new hostname> placeholder with your chosen host name.
hostnamectl set-hostname <new hostname> 
For example:
hostnamectl set-hostname newhost.mycompany.com
4
. 
Run the following command to restart 
systemd-hostnamed
 daemon to update the changes.
systemctl restart systemd-hostnamed
5
. 
Run the following command to check the host name again.
hostnamectl
Configure the hosts file in the etc directory
If the Domain Name Service (DNS) isn't configured in your environment, configure the 
/etc/hosts
 file on every node (control
plane and worker) in the cluster. List all the control plane nodes, worker nodes, external database servers, external access
host (HA virtual IP, load balancer), and NFS servers in the 
/etc/hosts
 file. In an environment that doesn't have DNS configured,
you must also configure the 
KUBE_DNS_HOSTS
 parameter in the 
install.properties
 file as described in the "Configure the
install.properties file" topic. To set up the host name resolution after the installation, follow the steps listed in the "Update the
DNS entries" topic.
Add the IP address and FQDN details of all the nodes in the cluster. This includes the external access host (HA virtual IP, load
balancer), external database servers, and NFS server. Add an entry for each server using the following syntax:
<IP address> <FQDN>
For example, you can add the following entries to the 
/etc/hosts
 file:
192.0.2.0 external-accesshost.mycompany.com
192.0.2.1 control1.mycompany.com
192.0.2.2 control2.mycompany.com
192.0.2.3 control3.mycompany.com
192.0.2.4 worker1.mycompany.com
192.0.2.5 worker2.mycompany.com
192.0.2.6 worker3.mycompany.com
192.0.2.7 externalbalancer.mycompany.com
192.0.2.8 externaldb.mycompany.com
192.0.2.9 nfs.mycompany.com
