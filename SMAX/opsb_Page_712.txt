Prepare external databases for CMS
For this release, you must use separate PostgreSQL databases instances for SMAX and containerized CMS for these reasons:
Because of the different dimensions of SMAX and CMS database sizing, if SMAX and CMS share the same PostgreSQL
database, the PostgreSQL instance size will be much larger than the size of separate ones.
There are unknown issues and risks if SMAX and CMS share the same PostgreSQL database.
To prepare PostgreSQL for CMS, perform the following tasks.
Install PostgreSQL
Follow the official PostgreSQL documentation for installation instructions to create a separate PostgreSQL database server for
CMS.
Configure database server
1
. 
Optionally, enable TLS connections for the PostgreSQL database server. See 
Enable TLS connections to external
PostgreSQL
.
Both SSL modes (verify-full and verify-ca) are supported. For details, see the PostgreSQL documentation.

. 
Configure the 
postgresql.conf
 file
In the 
postgresql.conf
 file, configure the following parameters depending on your CMS deployment size (Small, Medium,
or Large).
Note that the default value of the 
listen_addresses
 parameter is "
localhost
", which means only localhost can connect to the
PostgreSQL instance. You need to set 
listen_addresses = '*'
 to allow remote connections.
The following table provides example database settings for your reference.

Configure encoding and locale. Make sure that the PostgreSQL instance uses the following encoding and locale settings:
Encoding: UTF8
LC_COLLATE: en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE: en_US.UTF-8
Create CMS database users and databases
In the CMS application, the following components require databases:
UCMDB Server
AutoPass License Service (APLS)
Data Flow Probe
Note
It is strongly recommended to host the database server on a 
physical machine
, and it should be an
independent server without other applications running on it.
Also, if the database server machine is a virtual machine, the resource MUST be dedicated to the database
server.
Database servers must be set to the same time zone, daylight savings settings and time as the Universal
CMDB servers.
The UCMDB server should be located in the same LAN as the database servers (without a proxy and firewalls
between them). Otherwise, your system's performance may be impacted.

Note 
The Data Flow Probe database is not required if you plan to deploy CMS without containerized Data Flow
