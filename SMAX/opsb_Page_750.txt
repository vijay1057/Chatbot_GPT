Generate sensitive data for OO
The outcome of this step is the creation of a Kubernetes secret named 
oo-secret
, that holds the required sensitive data OO
needs to be installed: the passwords of the database users created during the preparation steps and the suite IDM integration
passwords. 
The name of this Kubernetes secret is by default referenced in the OO values.yaml file (at the Helm parameter
global.initSecrets
), and at the time of OO install it's data is automatically consumed by the deployed OO pods.
Use the 
gen_secrets.sh
 tool from OMT to prepare the sensitive data.

. 
Run the following command on the control plane node:
$CDF_HOME/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n <
OO namespace
> -c <
OO chart file
>
Where:
<OO namespace>
 is the unique namespace of the OO deployment. Use the namespace that you specified in the
Create a new deployment for OO
 topic.
<OO chart file>
 is the absolute path of the OO chart file
For example:
$CDF_HOME/scripts/gen_secrets.sh -n oo-prod -c OO_Helm_Chart-2022.11/oo-helm-charts/charts/oo-1.0.3+20221101.xx.tgz
