Create a new deployment for OO in EKS
You can use the 
cdfctl.sh 
script provided by Optic Management Toolkit (OMT) to create a new deployment. This deployment
contains a namespace, default certificate and service account used by Helm when installing the OO chart.

. 
Log in to the bastion node and navigate to the OMT installation directory:
cd OMT_External_K8s_2022.xx.xxxxx/scripts/
2
. 
Run the following command to create the deployment:
./cdfctl.sh deployment create -d <OO DEPLOYMENT NAME> [-n <OO NAMESPACE>]
The 
-n
 option is optional. If you don't specify this option, a namespace that uses the deployment name you specified for
the 
-d
 option gets created. However, you can specify the 
-n
 option if you want to use a custom namespace.
For example:
./cdfctl.sh deployment create -d oo
A message that resembles the following indicates that you have installed the application deployment successfully.
INF Creating deployment ... name=<OO DEPLOYMENT NAME> namespace=<OO NAMESPACE>
INF Created namespace "<OO NAMESPACE>" ...
INF Successfully created deployment "<OO DEPLOYMENT NAME>" uuid=<UUID>
View the installed deployments
Run the following command on the bastion node to view the installed applications:
cd OMT_External_K8s_2022.xx.xxxxx/scripts/cdfctl.sh deployment get
Your terminal resembles the following:
UUID     NAME                   NAMESPACE          STATUS   TYPE
<UUID>   <OO DEPLOYMENT NAME>   <OO NAMESPACE>     OK       SECONDARY
