Clusters can be scaled by reconfiguring the nodes. Administrators can upgrade the hardware like swapping CPUs, adding more
RAM or upgrading the disks.
Before nodes maintenance can be performed, a node must drained off all running containers and marked so that no new
functionality will be scheduled for it.
The following steps are need to be performed:
Mark the node as un-schedulable - no new workload to be scheduled.
Drain the node off all running workload
Perform the required maintenance
Mark the node as schedulable
If the node is to be replaced completely then the steps are as follows:
Mark the node as un-schedulable - no new workload to be scheduled.
Drain the node off all running workload
Delete the node from the cluster
Decommission the old server
Prepare the new server
Install the node and add the node to the cluster
Refer to the Suite documentation for details on how to perform these tasks.
Deleting nodes
Before nodes maintenance can be performed, a node must drained off all running containers and marked so that no new
functionality will be scheduled for it.
If the node is to be removed completely then the steps are as follows:
Mark the node as un-schedulable - no new workload to be scheduled.
Drain the node off all running workload
Delete the node from the cluster
Decommission the server
 
Note
Consider cluster nodes as cattle, not as pets.
