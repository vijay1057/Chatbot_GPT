I/O Scheduling
This topic details how to change 
I/O Scheduling
 to a supported scheduler. 
Vertica
 requires that I/O Scheduling be set to
deadline
 or 
noop
. The installer checks what scheduler the system is using, reporting an unsupported scheduler issue with
identifier: 
S0150
. If the installer cannot detect the type of scheduler in use (typically if your system is using a RAID array), it
reports that issue with identifier: 
S0151
.
If your system is not using a RAID array, then complete the following steps to change your system to a supported I/O
Scheduler. If you are using a RAID array, then consult your RAID vendor documentation 
for the best performing scheduler for
your hardware.
Configure the I/O Scheduler
The Linux kernel can use several different I/O schedulers to prioritize disk input and output. Most Linux distributions use the
Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) scheme by default, which gives input and output requests equal priority. This scheduler is
efficient on systems running multiple tasks that need equal access to I/O resources. However, it can create a bottleneck when
used on 
Vertica
 drives containing the catalog and data directories, because it gives write requests equal priority to read
requests, and its per-process I/O queues can penalize processes making more requests than other processes.
Instead of the CFQ scheduler, configure your hosts to use either the Deadline or NOOP I/O scheduler for the drives containing
the catalog and data directories:
The Deadline scheduler gives priority to read requests over write requests. It also imposes a deadline on all requests.
After reaching the deadline, such requests gain priority over all other requests. This scheduling method helps prevent
processes from becoming starved for I/O access. The Deadline scheduler is best used on physical media drives (disks
using spinning platters), since it attempts to group requests for adjacent sectors on a disk, lowering the time the drive
spends seeking.
The NOOP scheduler uses a simple FIFO approach, placing all input and output requests into a single queue. This
scheduler is best used on solid state drives (SSDs). Because SSDs do not have a physical read head, no performance
penalty exists when accessing non-adjacent sectors.
Failure to use one of these schedulers for the 
Vertica
 drives containing the catalog and data directories can result in slower
database performance. Other drives on the system (such as the drive containing swap space, log files, or the Linux system
files) can still use the default CFQ scheduler (although you should always use the NOOP scheduler for SSDs).
There are two ways for you to set the scheduler used by your disk devices:
1
. 
Write the name of the scheduler to a file in the 
/sys
 directory.
--or--
2
. 
Use a kernel boot parameter.
Configure the I/O Scheduler - Changing the Scheduler Through the /sys Directory
You can view and change the scheduler Linux uses for I/O requests to a single drive using a virtual file under the 
/sys
 directory.
The name of the file that controls the scheduler a block device uses is:
/sys/block/
deviceName
/queue/scheduler
Where 
deviceName
 is the name of the disk device, such as 
sda
 or 
cciss\!c0d1
 (the first disk on an 
Micro Focus
 RAID array).
Viewing the contents of this file shows you all of the possible settings for the scheduler. The currently-selected scheduler is
surrounded by square brackets:
# cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
noop deadline [cfq]
To change the scheduler, write the name of the scheduler you want the device to use to its scheduler file. You must have root
privileges to write to this file. For example, to set the sda drive to use the deadline scheduler, run the following command as
root:
# echo deadline > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
# cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
noop [deadline] cfq
Changing the scheduler immediately affects the I/O requests for the device. The Linux kernel starts using the new scheduler
for all of the drive's input and output requests.
Note
While tests show that changing the scheduler settings while 
Vertica
 is running does not cause problems, 
Vertica
recommends shutting down. Before changing the I/O schedule, or making any other changes to the system
configuration, consider shutting down any running 
database.
