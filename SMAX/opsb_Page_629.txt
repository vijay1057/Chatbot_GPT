Run a precheck on the control plane nodes and worker nodes
Before you run the install script on the first control plane node, you can run the 
pre-check.sh
 script to check the environment
settings. When you run the 
pre-check.sh
script, it doesn't read the install.properties file. Instead, it runs with a set of default
parameter values.  The 
pre-check.sh
 
--help
 command displays the list of parameters you can specify for the script to check.  It
also displays the default values it checks if you don't override them in the command line.
To run a precheck on a node, perform the following steps.
1
. 
Log on to the node.
2
. 
Navigate to the 
OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx.00xxx/scripts
 directory. 
For the first control plane node where you have downloaded and unzipped the OMT installation package, run the
following command:
cd <OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx.00xxx>/scripts
For other nodes, copy the 
<OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx.00xxx>/scripts/pre-check.sh
 script from the first control plane node
to a temporary directory. Then run the following command to add the execute permission:
chmod +x pre-check.sh
3
. 
Run the following command to run a preliminary check of a node:
./pre-check.sh --node-type <node type>
Where:
Replace <node type> with the actual node type. The supported values are: "first", "master", and "worker". "first"
refers to the first control plane node. "master" refers to the remaining control plane nodes except the first one. 
You can view more options with the 
-h
 option. If you want to check the node settings with some custom settings, add the
related options with the specified values. For example: if your node has 32 GB memory and  8-core CPUs, you can run the
following command:
./pre-check.sh --mem 32 --cpu 8
4
. 
If you receive an error, troubleshoot it according to the error message and resolve the problem before you install OMT.
5
. 
After resolving any errors, run the 
pre-check.sh 
script again until all the errors are resolved.
Below is an example of running a preliminary check on a node.
[root@shc scripts]# ./pre-check.sh --node-type first

manually and open the required ports.)
