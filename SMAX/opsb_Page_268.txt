In the Clone License Rule, enter the specific details for Name and Code, along with Publisher and what Metric will be used.
Then click on 
Clone
.
The newly created Rule is now added. As with creating a new rule, it still needs to be published before it can be used. Also it’s
possible to edit the rule with the relevant details in order to do the appropriate calculations for how the rule should work.
Troubleshooting
When troubleshooting SAM there is a good level of detail within the Practitioner Documents site: 
Troubleshoot SAM
.
This section aims to provide a few additional hints and tips in order to troubleshoot using SAM.
SAM Logs
On the NFS server that SMAX is configured to use check the following location:
For example:
/var/vols/itom/itsma/global-volume/logs/sam/
In this location there is a number of folder locations dependent on the SAM components that are running.
These are as follows: 
Backend   
Init    
UI
The key logs to look at if SAM isn’t working correctly are:    
Full.log    
Spring.log
If when running a compliance or analysis SAM doesn’t return the expected results the following logs are also worth looking at:  
 
Full_adapter.log    
Full_calc.log
There is also a couple of folders to look in when troubleshooting compliance calculations inside /SAM/Backend/<TenantID>    
Adapter    
Compliance
Inside these folders are the results for what SAM worked out using the information held in UCMDB & SMAX against the License
rules applied to the products used by SAM. If a compliance report didn’t produce the expected results for a certain product
then these logs are good to help understand why. They are normally named after the product in the Compliance area for
example MCAFEE_MCAFEE VIRUSSCAN_calc.log, which would look like this:
