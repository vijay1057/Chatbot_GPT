to use scripting or some data conversion process in order to get the data in the desired format.
The following is an example of a ‘Get’ request that will retrieve results from Service Management Automation X. In the
example the Id, DisplayLabel and Priority fields are being returned for request entities.
The request URL is created as follows:
https://myhost.domain.com/rest/844143557/ems/Request?layout=Id,DisplayLabel,Priority
The URL is created with the following information:
https:// — specifies the protocol to use
myhost.domain.com — the domain of the Service Management Automation X server master node which hosts the specific
tenant
rest — specifies the use of the REST API
844143557 — the tenant ID of the desired Service Management Automation X instance
ems — specifies the use of the EMS REST API
Request — The entity type
?layout=Id,DisplayLabel,Priority — specifies the comma delimited list of fields from the entity that should be included in
the response (note that the LastUpdateTime field is always returned)
The end of the query result will also return the number of records that matched the query, if the total count is more than 250,
the skip command is required to display additional records after the first 250. In the example below the ‘&skip=250’
parameter is added to retrieve the additional records. In cases where you expect more than 250 records to be returned,
writing a script or code to process the queries and results is recommended.
 
​
The URL to skip the first 250 records of the query is: 
https://myhost.domain.com/rest/844143557/ems/Request?
layout=Id,DisplayLabel,Priority&skip=250
