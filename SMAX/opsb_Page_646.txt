Configure the install.properties file
The installation parameters are available in the 
OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/install.properties
 file. Before you run the installer,
configure this file according to your deployment requirements. If you skip this step at this point, you will also have a chance to
specify all parameters in the 
install.properties
 file later, by using command line options when you run the 
install
 shell script. 
To configure the parameters:
1
. 
In a text editor, open the 
install.properties
 file.
2
. 
Change the value of the parameter based on your installation requirement. A complete list of the parameters is provided
below.
3
. 
Save the file.
General guidelines
When configuring the parameters, follow these guidelines.
If any of your cluster node servers (control plane or worker nodes) are in different subnets,  or you are installing into
supported cloud environments (such as AWS and Azure), set the 
FLANNEL_BACKEND_TYPE
 parameter to 
vxlan
;
otherwise, you don't need to edit that parameter.
You must configure the 
HA_VIRTUAL_IP
 or 
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST
 parameter to install a multiple-control plane node
cluster: If all control plane node servers are in the same subnet, you must configure
either 
HA_VIRTUAL_IP
 or 
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST
; if the control plane node servers are in different subnets, you must
configure 
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST
.
Use 
K8S_PROVIDER="cdf"
 (default) to use the embedded Kubernetes in OMT.
For a non-DNS environment, configure 
KUBE_DNS_HOSTS
 and create a hosts file. 
You must set 
SET_FQDN_IN_INGRESS 
to 
false
 for SMA. 
Set 
FAIL_SWAP_ON
 to false for SMA. You will receive a swap-related warning message during the installation, which you
can safely ignore.
Make sure the folder defined in 
TMP_FOLDER
 has 1777 permission (default: 
TMP_FOLDER=/tmp
).
Certain Fluentd parameters are used to export OMT logs to a remote server (an Elasticsearch, Operations Bridge
Analytics, or NFS server). By default, OMT logs are exported to the NFS volume (
itom-logging-vol
) that you configure
later, on the File Storage page of the installation portal. 
SMA doesn't support FIPS mode for embedded Kubernetes deployment. You must set the 
ENABLE_FIPS
 parameter to
false
 (default), and make sure that FIPS mode is disabled on your control plane node and worker node machines (click
here
 for detailed steps). 
You must use the default value for the 
CDF_NAMESPACE
 parameter. This release of the suite doesn't support a custom
namespace other than 
core
. 
Installation of the Monitoring capability
The monitoring capability enables you to monitor your deployment using Prometheus and to display the results using Grafana
dashboards. The installation of this capability is optional.
The 
Capabilities
 parameter controls whether to include the Monitoring capability in the OMT installation. You have two
options:
Option 1 (default): Include. This is the default option. The 
Capabilities
 parameter enables the Monitoring capability by
default (
Monitoring=true
).
 
Note that the monitoring capability requires you to configure an additional NFS volume (itom-monitor-vol). See 
Configure
NFS volumes
.
Option
 
2: Don't include. This option requires you to set 
Monitoring=false
 in the 
Capabilities
 parameter. After the OMT
and suite installation, you still have a chance to enable this capability (see 
Enable the monitoring capability
).
Pros
Cons
The monitoring capability monitors
the following:
Certificate expiration
Disk space
This capability requires additional extra hardware resources (at least 1~2 Core
CPU, 4 GB memory, and 20 GB disk space).
The monitoring capability provides
the following reports:
OMT IdM dashboards
Alerts on overall k8s cluster
status
Persistent volumes stats
Pods metrics (by namespace)
Prometheus performs data scraping every 30 seconds by default, which has
some impact on your system performance. 
Note
 The following table describes the pros and cons of enabling the monitoring capability.

Tip
: After you have installed the Monitoring capability, you can still disable it if you like. For more information,
