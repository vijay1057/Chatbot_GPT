Install and configure Vertica database
If you plan to install CGRO, you must install and configure the Vertica database as a prerequisite.  You can install by creating
a Vertica cluster using a CloudFormation template and step-by-step wizards in MC, or manually deploy using an Amazon
Machine Image (AMI) where Vertica is installed when you create your instances. 
Eon Mode databases
 are currently only
supported on AWS resources. For the AWS-specific installation procedure, see 
Deploy AWS Instances for your Vertica Database
Cluster
.
For information on configuring Vertica database, see
