Additional hardware requirements for OO Containerized with a dedicated database
The following sizing requirements denote the target deployment size for a dedicated OO database, based on the number of
tenants. This is not based on concurrent users.

 For EBS backend storage, including EBS backend storage used for OS storage and overlay2, and EBS backend RDS services,
you may switch to IO1 instead of GP2 for better performance. For more details, see 
EBS storage
 and

Additional hardware requirements for CMS
Native SACM and SAM require you to install CMS (UCMDB Server and CMS Gateway). You have two options:
Classic CMS + Classic CMS Gateway
Containerized CMS (which comes with the UCMDB Server and CMS Gateway)
See 
here
 for the supported CMS versions in this release.
Plan additional hardware resources for CMS: 
If you plan to use classic CMS, install CMS Gateway on the UCMDB Server, and add the following minimal resources for
CMS Gateway (for classic CMS hardware resource requirements, see 
Classic CMS sizing recommendations
):
documentation. Example: To configure Postgres HA, see 
High Availability PostgreSQL with Patroni
.
