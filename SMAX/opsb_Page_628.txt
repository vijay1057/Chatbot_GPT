Perform preliminary checks
The 
pre-check.sh
 script will check a lot of items of your Kubernetes cluster nodes, including the swap setting. Note that the
suite requires you to enable swap on each control plane node or worker node, and you can ignore the warning that indicates
swap isn't disabled on your node.
Role
Location
Privileges required
System administrator
All control plane nodes and worker nodes
Root or sudo
The preliminary checking of a node is optional. However, we recommend that you perform a preliminary check on all the
control plane nodes and worker nodes before you perform the preparation tasks to check whether your prepared nodes meet
some basic requirements of OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) installation. 
You can use the 
pre-check.sh
 script to do a test-run of the nodes that you prepare for the installation, and correct potential
issues you may meet during installation. 
Checking items
The 
pre-check.sh
 script can check the following items:
 
Items
Details
Firewall
configuration
If the firewalld service has been enabled, you will receive a warning message to inform you how to
disable the auto firewall configuration function. 
CDF_HOME
 setting
Checks whether the installation directory for the OMT binaries is empty.  If it's not empty, you will
receive a warning message.  
Checks the free disk space of the installation directory for the OMT binaries.
By default, the OMT installation directory is
 /opt/cdf
. You can override this by setting the 
$CDF_HOM
E 
environment variable.  If you specify the 
--cdf-home
 parameter, then this will take precedence
over 
$CDF_HOME
.
RUNTIME_CDFDATA_H
OME
 setting
Checks the free disk space of the directory for the OMT runtime data.
By default, the directory for the OMT runtime data is 
/opt/cdf/data
. You can override this by setting
the 
$RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME 
environment variable.  If you specify the 
--runtime-home
 parameter,
then this will take precedence over 
$RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME
.
Overlayfs setting
Checks if the current node matches the requirement of using 
overlayfs
 as the storage driver.
CPU, memory, disk
setting
Checks if the CPU, memory, and disk on this node match the sizing requirements.
Temporary
directory sizing
By default, the temp directory is 
/tmp
. You can override this by setting the 
$TMP_FOLDER
environment variable.  If you specify the 
--tmp
 parameter, then this will take precedence over 
$TM
P_FOLDER
.
POD_CIDR
, 
SERVER_C
IDR
 configuration
Checks the format of 
POD_CIDR
 and  
SERVER_CIDR.
Checks the capacity of the subnet base on the 
POD_CIDR
 setting.
Checks the capacity of the subnet base on the 
SERVICE_CIDR
 setting.
Checks the network overlap between 
POD_CIDR
 and host network,  
POD_CIDR
 and 
SERVICE_CIDR
.
Non-root user
name
If you provide a username with the --user option, the script will check the configurations of this
user in 
/etc/sudoers
 file.
Port availability
Checks all the availability of the required ports.
Required packages
or commands 
Checks whether all required commands or packages are installed.
Host name
resolution
Checks the availability of DNS servers on this node.
Checks the IP address and hostname in the 
/etc/hosts
 file.
Swap setting
Checks if the swap has been enabled on the node. Checks the related kubelet startup parameter.
The installation
status
of Containerd
and Kubernetes
Checks if the node has already installed Containerd and Kubernetes service.
HTTP Proxy settings
Checks if the 
http_proxy
, 
https_proxy
, and 
no_proxy
 have been set on this node.
System parameters
Checks if the 
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables
,
 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables
, and
net.ipv4.ip_forward
 parameter equal to 1.

 This topic contains legacy terms that aren't yet fully removed from OMT. Instances of “master” in this
topic refer to the control plane or to the control plane nodes.
