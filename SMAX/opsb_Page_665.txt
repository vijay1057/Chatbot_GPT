Disable on-access security scans
OMT installation may fail if you have enabled on-access scanning by security products such as McAfee Endpoint Security,
Microsoft Defender, or TrendMicro Deep Security Agent in your environment.
This failure often occurs because the security product can't handle the large number of small files that are created and deleted
during the image download and upload process. To prevent this, we recommend that you exclude certain directories on the
first control plane node from the on-access scan during the installation. You can remove these exclusions after installation,
although you may have to reinstate them when you upgrade OMT.
<RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME>
. The kubernetes infrastructure runtime data directory. Note that the runtime directory doesn't
yet exist (the install command creates it), so you must create the directory in order to exclude it. The default runtime
directory is the same as the data subdirectory of the OMT home directory (
opt/cdf/data
), which is specified in the 
CDF_HOM
E
 parameter.  Create a directory using this default value unless you have defined a different value in the 
CDF_HOME
 or 
RU
NTIME_CDFDATA_HOME
 parameters of the 
install.properties
 file, or will specify a custom directory using command options
when you run the 
install
 command. Make sure that you exclude the 
<RUNTIME_CDFDATA_HOME>
 directory and all its
subdirectories.
The temporary installation directory. By default, this is 
/tmp
, unless you have defined a different value in the
TMP_FOLDER
 parameter of the 
install.properties
 file.
/var/opt/cdf/offline/
. This is the default directory to which OMT downloads images.
For detailed information about how to exclude directories from on-access scans, refer to your security provider's
documentation.
