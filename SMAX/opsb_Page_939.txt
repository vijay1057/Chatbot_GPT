Get connection details for connecting to the IdM service
of SMAX
This topic contains instructions on how to integrate OO with the IdM service of SMAX.
You'll use the information obtained from 
Generate sensitive data for OO
 in the following steps.
Obtain the password for the IdM transport user
Run the following commands on the bastion node to obtain the password from SMAX's vault for the user 
idmTransportUser
. You'll
need to use this user for the integration between OO and IdM.
Get SMAX namespace:
SMAX_NS=$(echo `kubectl get ns | grep itsma | awk '{print $1}'`) && echo $SMAX_NS
Get SMAX's IdM pod name:
SMAX_IDM_POD=$(echo `kubectl get pods -n $SMAX_NS | grep -m1 idm- | head -1 | awk '{print $1}'`) && echo $SMAX_IDM_POD
Get the password for SMAX's IdM user 
idmTransportUser:
TRANSPORT_PASS=$(kubectl exec -it $SMAX_IDM_POD -n $SMAX_NS -c idm -- bash -c "/bin/get_secret idm_transport_admin_password_secret_key" | awk -F= '{print$2}') && echo $TRANSPORT_PASS
Get IdM Signing Key:
IDM_SIGNING_KEY=$(kubectl exec -it $SMAX_IDM_POD -n $SMAX_NS -c idm -- bash -c "/bin/get_secret idm_token_signingkey_secret_key itom-bo" | awk -F= '{print$2}') && echo $IDM_SIGNING_KEY
