For the body of the request, select the ‘form-data’ option. Create an entry with a key of ‘files[]’, then select ‘File’ from the
dropdown to the right of the value field. Now you may use the ‘Choose Files’ button to select the file that you wish to add as an
attachment.
Once you have selected the file you may send the request. Postman automatically handles the settings for the ‘Content-
Disposition’ and ‘Content-Type’ keys that were used in the earlier example.
Step #2 — Adding the Attachment to an Incident
After the attachment has been successfully added, it must be attached to the proper Incident. To perform this operation, the
IncidentAttachments entry must be updated with information from the attachment response. This property contains a special
‘complexTypeProperties’ array in which the specific attachment properties are added. The properties that make up one entry
in the complexTypeProperties include:
properties - this is the top level attribute that contains all other attributes
id - the 
guid
 returned in the attachment response
file_name - the 
name
 returned in the attachment response
file_extension - the extension from the 
name
 property above (.txt for example)
size - the 
contentLength
 from the attachment response
mime_type - the 
contentType
 from the attachment response
Creator - the user that added the attachment, this should be the current login id/email
The Incident is then updated using the standard REST request (this can be the EMS REST API or the Case Exchange API). In our
example above, the request body for updating the incident with id ‘27496’ would look like:
{  
   "entities":[  
      {  
         "entity_type":"Incident",
         "properties":{  
            "Id":"27496",       
            "IncidentAttachments":"{
                 \"complexTypeProperties\":[
                      {
                        \"properties\":{ 
                            \"id\":\"eac57a20-76e5-4318-842e-e46d3b6269c5\",
                            \"file_name\":\"test.txt\",
                            \"file_extension\":\"txt\",
                            \"size\":\"36\",
                            \"mime_type\":\"text/plain\",
                            \"Creator\":\"my.email@mf.com\"
                                       }
                      }
                  ]
             }"
         }
      }
   ],
   "operation":"UPDATE"
}
Once the request updates the Incident, the attachment will be linked to the Incident. However, this will replace any other
attachments that had been previously linked.
Adding attachments to an Incident
In order to add an attachment to an Incident rather than overwrite any existing attachments, an extra REST Request is
required to get the existing IncidentAttachments attribute. This can be done with the standard GET REST Request.
When creating the Request Body to update the Incident with the new attachment, the existing ‘complexTypeProperties’ array
should be updated with a new array entry that contains the properties of the new attachment (as seen in the above example).
