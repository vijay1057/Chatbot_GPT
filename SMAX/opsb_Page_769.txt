The command also has a 
-p
 option to give your password. The 
-p
  option doesn't support single quotes (that is, don't
include single quotes in the password).
Transfer the images to the control plane node
If you downloaded the images to a server other than the first control plane node, transfer the images to a directory on the first
control plane node. As default, place the images under the  
/var/opt/cdf/offline
 directory.
Note
By selecting the -p option, you are disabling or bypassing security features, thereby exposing the system to
increased security risks. By using this option, you understand and agree to assume all associated risks and hold
Micro Focus harmless for the same.
Micro Focus encourages you to use some other password options, which aren't provided by Micro Focus. By
implementing the -p option, you may expose the system to increased security risks. You understand and agree to
assume all associated risks and hold Micro Focus harmless for the same. It remains at all times your sole
responsibility to assess its own regulatory and business requirements. Micro Focus doesn't represent or warrant

Note
:
uploadimages.sh
 script will upload the images later. The image upload requires up to 2 times of the image size
space in the target image directory. For example, if you choose to use the default 
/var/opt/cdf/offline
 directory,
ensure that you have 2 times of the OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) and suite image size space under 
/var/opt/cd
f/offline
 directory of the control plane node
