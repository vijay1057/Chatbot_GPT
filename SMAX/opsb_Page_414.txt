In this networking model every container has a single network interface eth0 which is mapped into the container from a virtual
interface (veth) at the host level that is created for every container. These virtual interfaces are connected to a bridge-type
interface "cni0" and a subnet from which the containers receive an IP address.

This model allows each container on a host to talk to every other container on the same host but not to a container running on
another host.
To allow cross-host communication requires setting up port forwarding and/or proxying.
Cross-host communication is required in a Kubernetes cluster which almost always consists of multiple hosts.

Network fabric for Kubernetes
See: 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/
Setting up port forwarding across multiple containers, hosts and users isn't a viable model as the number of containers, hosts
and users rises.
Therefore Kubernetes requires a slightly different network fabric configuration.
Kubernetes by itself won't work if you were to install it across multiple hosts without the configuration of some network fabric.
The fabric provides the ability for each container on every host to talk to every other container on every other node.
No network address translation (NAT) is required. The Kubernetes documentation words this nicely as three items:
all containers can communicate with all other containers without NAT
all nodes can communicate with all containers (and vice-versa) without NAT
the IP that a container sees itself as is the same IP that others see it as
