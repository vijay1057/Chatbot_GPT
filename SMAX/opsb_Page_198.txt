When to Create Problems
So how do we know that we have a problem? There are two primary methods we can use to create new problems: manual and
guided.
Manual Problem Analysis
This part of the problem analysis process simply means we are looking at specific incidents as they occur. In this way, we are
capitalizing on the knowledge of our agents as they resolve everyday issues. If an agent recognizes that an incident is very
similar to one they have already looked at (or thinks it might readily occur again) they can create a problem directly from the
incident — if they have the rights to create a new problem.
If they don’t have the rights to create a new problem, they simply mark the incident as a 'Problem candidate'. Our problem
managers — agents responsible for the problem management process — will review all the flagged incidents. During the
review, the problem manager will determine whether or not to create a problem from the incident.
Guided Problem Analysis
Guided Problem analysis takes advantage of Service Management Automation X’s powerful Big Data tools to analyze incident
data to assist the problem managers in finding trends that may point out problems that aren’t apparent in manual analysis.
Using the Hot Topic Analytics engine on the incident records, the problem manager can find patterns and recurrences of
related incidents. From these grouped incidents, they can then create a problem from multiple Incidents. These incidents will
be linked to the created problem, so when the problem moves forward in its workflow Service Management Automation X
updates the incident owners with relevant information.
