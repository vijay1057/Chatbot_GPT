Remove persistent volumes
If you created PVs based on the

, you can run
the following command to delete the persistent volumes:
kubectl delete -f itom-audit-pv.yaml
Clean the NFS volumes
Log on to the NFS server host and clear all the contents in the NFS volume directories that you created.
For example:
rm -rf /var/vols/itom/audit/auditns/vault/*
rm -rf /var/vols/itom/audit/auditns/log/*
Clean the databases
The Audit uninstallation process doesn't remove the databases from the external PostgreSQL server. You need to remove the
databases manually.
