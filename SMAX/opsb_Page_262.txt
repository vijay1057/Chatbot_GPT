The number of Products the agent has configured will determine the number shown on the screen above, in this case 2.
Click on the tile to drill down for more information.
The agent will then see a screen similar to what is shown below:
The agent can look at what Software products are held in SAM on the left hand side of the screen, and details of the actual
devices that have that product installed on the right.
If the License Model was more complex rather than the Generic per Device, the number of processors and the cores per
processor columns would then be important to the agent. In this example they are not required, but the columns are provided
to allow the agent to understand how each device is configured and how that could potentially impact on the License
consumption points for each Software License they create.
If the Agent clicks on any of the Device Names list in the Devices screen, they can drill down to understand how the device is
consuming the product. There are three options, General, Deployment and Consumption.
General Tab
This page gives the same level of detail shown on the previous page listing all the devices but now specific to the device
selected by the Agent.
Deployment Tab
