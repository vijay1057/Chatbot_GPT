KEEPALIVED_ADVERT_INT
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter specifies the VRRP advertisement interval in seconds. When the backup Keepalived doesn't receive the VRRP
advertisement from the control plane Keepalived within three times of the defined period, the transit from the backup
Keepalived to the control plane Keepalived is triggered. The expected values are integers.
We don't expect any change of the default value unless you are an expert of Keepalived.
The recommended values are from 1 to 5.
The default value is 
1
.
Example:
KEEPALIVED_ADVERT_INT="1"
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST
Configuration of this parameter is mandatory if you are configuring multiple control plane and/or worker nodes in multiple
subnets. 
OMT provides two means to support multiple control plane nodes: the 
HA_VIRTUAL_IP
 and 
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST
 parameters.
If you use the 
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST 
parameter, you must set up an internal load balancer. The internal load balancer reverse
proxy also handles load balancing between the 
kube-apiserver/etcd
 services of all control plane nodes. For more information
about how to configure an internal load balancer, refer to the "Configure load balancers" topic.
The 
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST
 parameter supports control plane nodes in a single or multiple subnets. In the following examples,
the FQDN of the load balancer is 
mylb.lbtest.com
.
When all control plane nodes are in a single subnet:
./install \
--load-balancer-host "mylb.lbtest.com" \
--kube-dns-hosts ~/my.hosts \
--nfs-server <nfs-server> --nfs-folder <nfs-directory> [options...]
When the control plane and/or worker nodes are in different subnets, you must set the value of the
FLANNEL_BACKEND_TYPE
 to 
vxlan
 to enable this parameter:
./install \
--load-balancer-host "mylb.lbtest.com"\
 --kube-dns-hosts ~/my.hosts \
--flannel-backend-type vxlan \
--nfs-server <nfs-server> --nfs-folder <nfs-directory> [options...]
Example:
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST="192.0.2.0"
Or
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST="mylb.lbtest.com"
CERTIFICATE_PERIOD
Configuration of this parameter is optional.
This parameter specifies the validity period of internal certificates, which are referred to as server.crt, kubernetes.crt, and
client.crt. The specified validity period of these internal certificates will apply to all control plane nodes and worker nodes. The
certificate period must be no greater than 3660 days.
The default value is 365 days.
Example:
CERTIFICATE_PERIOD="365"
