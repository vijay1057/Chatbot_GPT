Launch RDS
Both OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) and the suite contain an internal (embedded) PostgreSQL database instance, which
should be used for demonstration purposes only. You must use external databases in a production environment. For
information about supported external databases, see 
Support matrix for EKS
.
When deployed on AWS, the suite uses RDS as the database engine. This RDS instance will be used as the external databases
for OMT IdM, OMT API Server, and the suite in a production environment.

AWS Management Console & Bastion node
We recommend that you use RDS as the database engine on AWS. Follow these steps to launch RDS.
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console and switch to the selected region.
2
. 
Go to 
All services
 > 
Management & Governance
 > 
CloudFormation
.
3
. 
Click 
Create stack
, click 
Template is ready
 > 
Upload a template file
 > 
Choose file
 and select the 
smax-rds.template
file under 
../Cloud Deployment x.x.x/../byok/smax-cloudformation-aws
.
4
. 
Click 
Next
 and populate the following fields:
Stack name:
 Give a name to this stack, such as 
sma-rds
.
VPC ID:
 Select the created VPC from the drop-down list.
First/Second Subnet for RDS:
 Select the two database subnets created for RDS.
RDS Instance Type:
 Select an instance type from the drop-down list. See 
Sizing considerations
.
RDS instance identifier:
 Enter an RDS instance name.
User name:
 Define a username for the database admin account, such as 
postgres
.
Password:
 Define a password for the database admin account.
RDS Storage size:
 Enter a storage size. See 
Sizing considerations
.
Postgres engine version:
 Type an engine version. See 
Support matrix
.
Multi-AZ RDS:
 Select 
false
 for test and development environments; select 
true
 for staging and production
environments.
BastionSecurityGroup
: Select the bastion's security group to allow the bastion node to communicate with RDS.
ClusterSecurityGroup
: Select the EKS cluster's security group (
eks-cluster-sg-*
) to allow the EKS cluster to
communicate with RDS.

. 
Click 
Next
 > 
Next
 > 
Create stack
. Wait until the stack creation is completed and you can check the results on the
Outputs
 tab.
After the RDS is created, you need to test its connectivity by running the commands below on the bastion node. 
sudo yum install -y postgresql
psql -h <RDSEndpointAddress> -U <postgres_admin> -d postgres
Where: 
<RDSEndpointAddress>
 can be collected in the 
Outputs
 of the previous step.
<postgres_admin>
 is the database admin user name you specified when creating RDS. Replace it with the actual value.
Next, set up two PostgreSQL databases for OMT on the created RDS instance.
Set up a PostgreSQL database for OMT IdM on the RDS instance
During the OMT installation, the installation portal UI will let you choose an 
out-of-the-box
 PostgreSQL or
an 
external
 PostgreSQL for the OMT IdM. You must use an external database for the OMT IdM in a production environment.
For an external PostgreSQL, the installation portal provides two options for configuring an external PostgreSQL database for
OMT IdM: manually or automatically. We recommend that you prepare a PostgreSQL instance and let the installer
automatically create a database for you. To do this, later when you configure OMT database settings on the installation portal,
select 
PostgreSQL 
and check the 
If no database is found, create a database automatically 
option (see 
step 5
 in 
Select
the deployment configuration
).
Note
: OMT uses two databases:
One for the OMT IdM. This database is normally referred to as the "OMT database." You will need to configure
this database later in the installation portal (see 
Select the deployment configuration
).
One for the OMT API Server. This database is for the cdf-apiserver service. You will need to specify this
database when deploying the bootstrap (see 
Deploy bootstrap
).

  Take a note of the value of 
RDSEndpointAddress
. It will be used in later steps.
