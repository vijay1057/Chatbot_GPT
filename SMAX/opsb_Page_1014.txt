Launch AKS cluster worker nodes for CMS
This task is required only when you need to install CMS. See 
Sizing guides (AKS)
 for information about the additional AKS
cluster worker nodes required to deploy CMS.
To create worker nodes for the CMS installation, make sure you have the 
Owner
 role and run this command in the Azure Cloud
Shell:
az aks nodepool add -g <resource_group_name> -n <node_pool> --cluster-name <kubernetes_cluster_name> --node-vm-size <node-vm-size> --node-count <node-count> --mode System --labels Worker=cms role=loadbalancer
where:
<resource_group_name>
: Enter the name of the resource group created in the prerequisite tasks. For example,
myResourceGroup
.
<node_pool>
: Specify the node pool name. The name should be different from the node pool name of the suite.
<kubernetes_cluster_name>
: Enter the name of the cluster created for the suite in the previous task.
<node_vm_size>
: Specify the size of virtual machines to create as Kubernetes nodes by referring to 
Sizing guides (AKS)
. For
example, 
Standard_D8s_v3
.
<node-count
>
: Specify the number of nodes in the Kubernetes node pool.
 
After you create the worker nodes for CMS, you can run the following command to check whether the 
cms 
label is successfully
assigned to the worker nodes:
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
Review the output to see if you can see
 
Worker:cms
 as the label for the worker nodes.
