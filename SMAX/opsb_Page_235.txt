The MT Console includes the following tabs.
Dashboard
Displays all managed customers including:
Total open requests and incidents for all managed tenants on the top right of the dashboard.
An icon per managed customer displaying open incidents or requests for that managed client. Hovering on the icon
displays a tooltip detailing the priority level of the open requests or incidents.
Totals for only the selected managed customers at the bottom of the dashboard. Each is a link to view the requests or
incidents of the selected customers in the request or incident grid. 
The information in the MT Console Dashboard is filtered to display only 
active
 incidents and requests by default.
You can add additional filters to limit the information you can view in the dashboard which works in the same way as it does on
any other view filter in SMAX; however, the number of fields available is limited.
You can also use the dashboard to select the customers to view in the requests and incidents grids.
Select a client by clicking the icon.
A selected customer has a checkmark added to its icon.
You can select up to five customers to view in the grids.
Requests
A grid view of the open requests for selected customers. You can select up to five customers to view in the grid.
Incidents
