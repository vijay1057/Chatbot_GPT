Locate and run the validation scripts as per the syntax given in the Vertica website.
Run the install_vertica script
To install the installed Vertica package using the install_vertica script, see the 
Installing Vertica with the Installation Script
 on
the Vertica website.
In the command below, replace 
<VerticaNode1>
 with the hostname of the system on which you are installing Vertica and
replace 
<vertica-version>
 with the vertica version dowloaded (such as 
10.0.1-3
). The data directory specifies where the bulk of
the database will be stored (in the remainder of the installation, this directory will be assumed to be /opt/vertica).
/opt/vertica/sbin/install_vertica --hosts <VerticaNode1> --rpm /tmp/vertica-<vertica-version>.x86_64.RHEL6.rpm --dba-user dbadmin --data-dir /opt/vertica
If you are installing Vertica on a single node, use that node's local loopback address in place of 
<VerticaNode1>
.
The script will create a dbadmin user and prompt you to set its password. This password will be assumed to be dbadmin in the
remainder of the installation instructions.
The script will also validate that all required prerequisites have been met. If the above command fails due to warnings about
the environment, despite having implemented all of the prerequisites, then you can override the warnings by adding the 
--failur
e-threshold FAIL
 option to the command.

After performing the above steps, Vertica should be running on the host. On the Vertica host, run 
su - dbadmin
 or log in as
the 
dbadmin
 user. Then run the 
/opt/vertica/bin/adminTools
 program. The program prompts you to enter a license file. Enter
the path to the license key that you downloaded earlier from the 
Micro Focus
 Software Licenses and Downloads Portal.

Select 
Accept
 for the End User License Agreement and exit the program.
Create the cgro database
Run the following command as the 
dbadmin
 user to create and start the cgro
 
database. Replace <VerticaNode1> with the
hostname on which Vertica has been installed. See the Vertica documentation for more information about available options.
/opt/vertica/bin/adminTools -t create_db -d cgro -p dbadmin --hosts=<VerticaNode1> --policy=always
Verify the license was applied
While logged in as the dbadmin user, run the following command:
vsql -U dbadmin -w dbadmin -c 'select display_license();'
You should see output similar to the following, indicating a 2 TB license has been applied.
            display_license
