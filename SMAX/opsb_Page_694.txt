(Optional) Install containerized CMS
The Native SACM and SAM solutions require a 
Micro Focus
 CMS system to work with the suite. Once you have completed
the suite installation, you can continue to install CMS on the same OMT cluster as the next deployment (the suite is the first
deployment). The following diagram shows the multi-deployment structure.
Using Multi-Customer mode
Customer in UCMDB is a data isolation mechanism. The Multi-Customer solution enables the management of multiple
separated customers on a single CMDB instance, with a complete separation of data between the customers. The following is a
high-level overview of the Multi-Customer architecture.
Important:
 UCMDB and SMAX both have the concept of "tenant," but it's important not to mix up the ideas of
UCMDB tenants and SMAX tenants. SMAX tenants correspond with UCMDB customers, while SMAX data domains
correspond with UCMDB tenants. When you have multiple tenants in SMAX, each of them needs to be associated
with a UCMDB customer.
