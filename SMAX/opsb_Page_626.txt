Download required installation packages
In this step, you need to download two packages from the 
Micro Focus Software Licenses and Downloads
 website for the suite
installation. 
Name
Binary name
Suite metadata package
itsma-suite-metadata-2022.11-
bxx.tgz
OPTIC Management Toolkit for Embedded Kubernetes Installation and

OMT2211-xxx-15001-Embedded-
K8s.zip
1
. 
Download the packages, and copy them to a temporary directory on the first control plane node.
2
. 
Run the following command to unzip the OMT installation and upgrade package:
unzip <OMT installation and upgrade package>
The unzipped file includes the following files:
OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx-xxx.zip
OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx-xxx.zip.sig
3
. 
(Optional) Verify the OMT installation and upgrade package. Skip this step if you don't want to verify the package.
a
. 
Using a web browser, visit the 
Micro Focus
 
Software Licenses and Downloads
 portal. Agree to the terms and
conditions, and then download the 
MF_public_keys.tar.gz
 package to a local directory.
b
. 
Run the following commands to extract the 
public_key_Micro_Focus_Group_Limited_RSA-2048-2.pub.asc
 public key from
the package. Save the key to a local directory.
gunzip MF_public_keys.tar.gz
tar -xvf MF_public_keys.tar MF_public_keys/public_key_Micro_Focus_Group_Limited_RSA-2048-2.pub.asc
c
. 
Run the following commands to import the keys for RPM:
rpm --import MF_public_keys/public_key_Micro_Focus_Group_Limited_RSA-2048-2.pub.asc
d
. 
Run the following commands to import the public key for GnuPG:
gpg --import /<path to the pubkey>/<your pubkey>
gpg --verify OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx-xxx.zip.sig OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx-xxx.zip
For example, you run the following commands:
gpg --import ./public_key_Micro_Focus_Group_Limited_RSA-2048-2.pub.asc
gpg --verify OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx-xxx.zip.sig OMT_Embedded_K8s_202x.xx-xxx.zip
e
. 
The following messages on the terminal indicate that the files are verified successfully:
gpg: Good signature from "public_key_Micro_Focus_Group_Limited_RSA-2048-2.pub.asc"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
f
. 
(Optional) To trust the public key and remove the warning message, run the following commands in sequence:
gpg --list-keys
gpg --edit-key <your pubkey>
trust
5
quit
The terminal should now appear as follows:
Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y
pub  2048R/6DAF72B7  created: 2020-03-28  expires: 2030-03-28  usage: SCEA

[ unknown] (1). public_key_Micro_Focus_Group_Limited_RSA-2048-2.pub.asc
Please note that the shown key validity is not necessarily correct
unless you restart the program.
