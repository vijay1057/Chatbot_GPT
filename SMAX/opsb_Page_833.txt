Configure bastion
This topic describes how to create and configure a bastion node. The bastion node communicates with the Kubernetes cluster
and we use it for deploying the SMA suite and troubleshooting.

AWS Management Console
To create a machine as bastion, follow these steps: 
1
. 
Go to 
All services
 > 
Management & Governance
 > 
CloudFormation
.
2
. 
Click 
Create stack
, click 
Template is ready
 > 
Upload a template file
 > 
Choose file 
to select a template file under
directory 
../Cloud Deployment x.x.x/../byok/smax-cloudformation-aws 
in 
the cloud deployment package
 as below: 
If you want to deploy the bastion on a public subnet, select the 
smax-bastion.template
 file.
If you want to deploy the bastion on a private subnet, select the 
smax-bastion-private.template
 file.
3
. 
Click 
Next
 and populate the following fields:
Stack name:
 Give a name to this stack, such as 
sma-bastion
.
VPC ID:
 Select the created VPC from the drop-down list.
Public/Private Subnet for Bastion instance:
 Select a created public/private subnet. If you select a public subnet,
make sure the 
Auto-assign public IPv4
 attribute of the public subnet is enabled.
Bastion AMI type:
 Select Amazon-Linux if you deploy SMA on GovCloud; or else, select CentOS-7
. 
See 
Sizing
considerations
.
Bastion AMI ID
: The AMI ID to create bastion. Leave as 
default 
if you wish to use our recommended AMI ID based
on the Bastion type selected. If specified, the system will generate bastion according to your input. See AWS
document to 
Find a Linux AMI
. To avoid issues when creating bastion, make sure your AMI architecure is 
x_86_64
,
your root device type is 
ebs
, your virtualization is 
hvm 
and your platform is 
CentOS
.  
Bastion Instance Type:
 Select an instance type from the drop-down list. See 
Sizing considerations
.
Bastion instance Root Volume Size:
 Specify a size in GB for the root EBS volume. See 
Sizing considerations
.
Key Pair for SSH access Bastion instance:
 Select the created EC2 key pair.
The security group for the Bastion
/
BastionSecurityGroup
: Select the security group created for the bastion
node.

. 
Click 
Next

, acknowledge the required capabilities, and click 
Create stack
. Wait until the stack creation finishes
and you can check the results on the

Bastion
After the bastion is created successfully, configure the bastion by running these commands:
1
. 
Log in to the bastion: 
ssh -i <private_key_pem_file> centos@<bastion_ip>
2
. 
Install Docker.
sudo yum install -y docker
3
. 
Enable Docker and empower to run Docker commands as non-root.
sudo groupadd docker 
sudo usermod -a -G docker ${USER}
sudo usermod -a -G docker root
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
4
. 
Download and install the 
kubectl
 binary for your cluster's 
Kubernetes version
 using the steps described in the 
AWS
documentation
.
5
. 
Install the AWS CLI version 2 by following the 
AWS document
.
Note
:  Ensure you have subscribed to an AMI, we recommend you subscribe to 
CentOS 7 (x86_64) - with
Updates HVM
. If not yet subscribed, visit 
Amazon marketplace
 to do so. If you plan to use a different image,
ensure to subscribe to that image.

Important
: Do not customize any ClusterRoles (for example, cluster-admin) in the system to avoid potential
issues.
