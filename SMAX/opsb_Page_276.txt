When the request is created, select the offering and populate the fields with the contact details. When the solution and
completion code are populated, the Request moves into the fulfill phase and the task plan will run and create the contact.
** Optionally, if it’s required that no manual intervention should occur when an end user creates a contact, a rule can be added
to populate the solution and completion code fields. When these fields are automatically populated the Request will move
straight from the log phase to accept phase after the contact is added. This would be the same for the updated user
information offering.
