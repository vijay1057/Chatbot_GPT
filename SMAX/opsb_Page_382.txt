Rules
A single rule will be added to send an email to the PDL when a new comment is added. This rule should only run if the PDL User
option has been filled in.
Task Plan
The work to set up the PDL, open the Bridge line, and invite the domain experts will be performed as tasks. Three tasks will be
defined for the “Initial support” phase of the Incident. Note that the tasks can either be created as serial (as they are here) or
parallel.
