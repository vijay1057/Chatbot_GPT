Service Level Targets
One thing regarding the request workflow I want to mention is the service level targets the system calculates for the request.
These targets measure the time it takes between certain steps in the process (the most important being the time between the
Request being created and resolved).
Service level targets are defined by the service level management process, which we will cover later. For now, it's enough to
know the target times for the request are determined by a combination of:
The service specified in the request
The priority of the request (which is calculated by the specified urgency and impact)
This results in the high priority requests having a shorter target time than those of low priority. Here’s a useful tip: sorting a
list of requests by the next target time gives an agent a great idea of what order they should tackle them in.
