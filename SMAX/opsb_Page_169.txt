approvals take place (and I have my over-sized “DENIED” stamp ready). If the proper people approve the request, it will move
into the 'Fulfill' phase, and if not it will move to 'Done' (and the end user will receive a notification that this happened).
Our agents can see what approvals are necessary and even which ones have already been approved or denied directly from
the Request. If they have the right role (remember those?) they can even change who needs to give their thumbs up for a
particular approval.
Notice how we can control the logic regarding what approvals the request requires and the order of those approvals. In this
example, the system will not process the 'Financial approval' will until someone approves the 'Manager approve' task.
Another nice thing we can do is allow our Agents to manually add approvals to the process from the request itself. If they have
the right role (that we defined earlier, remember) they can click to add new approval requirements to the request, then add
the person or group to that new approval.
Fulfillment
'Fulfillment' is where the work to fulfill the request is done (shocking, I know). With the 'Service' workflow, agents accomplish
this by working on tasks that defined in the associated offering and/or any manually created tasks. During the fulfillment step,
groups may pass the request back and forth. However, it will always be the responsibility of the owning service desk group to
ensure that the request gets completed.
The owner of the request can view the overall task plan directly from the request to see what tasks are in progress, which are
upcoming, and any that might have been unnecessary.
