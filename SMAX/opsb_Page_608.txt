/usr/sbin/ntpq -c rv | grep stratum
For Ubuntu and Debian:
ntpq -c rv | grep stratum
A stratum level of 16 indicates that NTP is not synchronizing correctly.
If a stratum level of 16 is detected, wait 15 minutes and issue the command again. It may take this long for the NTP server to
stabilize.
If NTP continues to detect a stratum level of 16, verify that the NTP port (UDP Port 123) is open on all firewalls between the
cluster and the remote machine to whicy you are attempting to synchronize.
