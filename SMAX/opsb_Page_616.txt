mcelog package. Identified by issue 
S0041
 when not installed.
sysstat package. Identified by issue 
S0045

Red Hat 6 and CentOS 6 Systems
To install the required tools on Red Hat 6 and CentOS 6 systems, run the following commands as sudo or root:
yum install pstack
yum install mcelog
yum install sysstat
Red Hat 7 and CentOS 7 Systems
To install the required tools on Red Hat 7/CentOS 7 systems, run the following commands as sudo or root:
yum install gdb

yum install sysstat
Ubuntu and Debian Systems
To install the required tools on Ubuntu and Debian systems, run the following commands as sudo or root:
apt-get install pstack
apt-get install mcelog
apt-get install sysstat
SuSE Systems
To install the required tools on SuSE systems, run the following commands as sudo or root.
zypper install sysstat
zypper install mcelog
There is no individual SuSE package for pstack/gstack. However, the gdb package contains gstack, so you could optionally
install gdb instead, or build pstack/gstack from source. To install the gdb package:
zypper install gdb
For Ubuntu 19.1, do not run 
apt-get install mcelog
. Instead, run 
apt-get install rasdaemon
.
