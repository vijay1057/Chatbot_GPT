Create a new deployment for CMS (AKS)
You can use the tool provided by OMT to create a deployment to get namespace, default certificate, and service account
prepared for installing an application by Helm charts.
1
. 
Log in to the bastion node and navigate to the OMT installation directory:
cd OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts/
2
. 
Run the following commands to create an ITOM application deployment:
./cdfctl.sh deployment create -t helm -d <CMS DEPLOYMENT NAME> [-n <CMS NAMESPACE>]
The -n option is optional. If you don't specify this option, a namespace that uses the deployment name you specified for
the -d option will be created. However, you can specify the -n option if you want to use a custom namespace.
For example:
./cdfctl.sh deployment create -t helm -d cms-prod
A message that resembles the following is displayed to indicate that you have installed the application deployment
successfully.
Administrator password:
