Enabling Network Time Protocol (NTP)
The network time protocol (NTP) daemon must be running on all of the hosts in the cluster so that their clocks are
synchronized. The spread daemon relies on all of the nodes to have their clocks synchronized for timing purposes. If your
nodes do not have NTP running, the installation can fail with a spread configuration error or other errors.
Verify That NTP Is Running
To verify that your hosts are configured to run the NTP daemon on startup, enter the following command:
$ chkconfig --list ntpd 
Debian and Ubuntu do not support 
chkconfig
, but they do offer an optional package. You can install this package with the
command 
sudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf
. To verify that your hosts are configured to run the NTP daemon on startup with the 
sysv
-rc-conf
 utility, enter the following command:
$ sysv-rc-conf --list ntpd 
The 
chkconfig
 command can produce an error similar to 
ntpd: unknown service
. If you get this error, verify that 
your Linux
distribution refers to the NTP daemon as 
ntpd
 rather than 
ntp
. If it does not, you need to install the NTP daemon package
before you can configure it. Consult your Linux documentation for instructions on how to locate and install packages.
If the NTP daemon is installed, your output should resemble the following:
ntp 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:off 5:on 6:off
The output indicates the runlevels where the daemon runs. Verify that the current runlevel of the system (usually 3 or 5) has
the NTP daemon set to 
on
. If you do not know the current runlevel, you can find it using the 
runlevel
 command:
$ runlevel
N 3
Configure NTP for Red Hat 6/CentOS 6 and SLES
If your system is based on Red Hat 6/CentOS 6 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, use the 
service
 and 
chkconfig
 utilities to start
NTP and have it start at startup.
/sbin/service ntpd restart
/sbin/chkconfig ntpd on
Red Hat 6/CentOS 6
—NTP uses the default time servers at ntp.org. You can change the default NTP servers by editing 
/e
tc/ntpd.conf
.
SLES
—By default, no time servers are configured. You must edit 
/etc/ntpd.conf
 after the install completes and add time
servers.
Configure NTP for Ubuntu and Debian
By default, the 
NTP daemon
 is not installed on some Ubuntu and Debian systems. First, install NTP, and then start the NTP
process. You can change the default NTP servers by editing 
/etc/ntpd.conf
as shown:
sudo apt-get install ntp
sudo /etc/init.d/ntp reload
Verify That NTP Is Operating Correctly
To verify that the Network Time Protocol Daemon (NTPD) is operating correctly, issue the following command on all nodes in
the cluster.
For Red Hat 6/CentOS 6 and SLES:
Note
Different Linux distributions refer to the NTP daemon in different ways. For example, SUSE and Debian/Ubuntu
refer to it as 
ntp
, while CentOS and Red Hat refer to it as 
ntpd
. If the following commands produce 
errors, try
using 
ntp
 in place of 
ntpd
