Access the ingress access log, locate the correct static resources, and check the response time as shown in the
screenshot below:

. 
If the response time is still more than 10s, you can scale out pairs of the 
ingress
 and 
xruntime-ui
 pods by running the
following commands:
kubectl scale deploy itom-nginx-ingress-deployment --replicas=<number> -n <namespace>
kubectl scale deploy itom-xruntime-ui --replicas=<number> -n <namespace>
In these commands, <number> is the replicas number you want to reach by scaling out and <namespace>is your suite
namespace.
Note
: One pair of 
ingress
 and 
xruntime-ui
 pods can support 8~15 concurrent users' login in one minute. Scale out
these two pods according to your requirement.
