example: 
db1.myhost.com
 and

.
Database name
: enter 
itom-cdf-idm
.
User
 and 
Password
: enter the name and password of your PostgreSQL admin user that has the "Superuser"
role. Don't use 
non-UTF-8
 characters such as "£" for the password.

. 
If your database requires Transport Layer Security (TLS), select 
Use TLS connection
, and then click 
Upload
 to
upload your database server certificate or the database server CA certificate in PEM format: upload your database
server certificate if using a self-signed certificate; otherwise, upload your database CA certificate, which must be a
concatenated file that contains the root CA certificate and all intermediate CA certificates in the certificate chain.
The installer will automatically create an empty database using the database information you entered. The installer will
also create a "cdfidm" user and set the "cdfidm" user as the database owner. After the installation, you can update this
external database configuration by running script 
$CDF_HOME/bin/updateExternalDbInfo
 with the 
--dbadmin
 option.

Select the deployment size
On the 
Deployment Size
 page, select a deployment size (Small, Medium, or Large), and then click 
NEXT
. For details, see

the deployment
.
Configure the connection
1
. 
On the 
Connection
 page, enter the external access hostname and port that you will use to access the suite user
interface.
For an installation with only one control plane node, the external hostname and port fields are automatically filled. By
default, the external hostname is the hostname of the first control plane node.
For an installation with more than one control plane node enter a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) that's resolved
to the virtual IP address of the external hostname. Provide the host names based on the following criteria:
Configuration of control plane nodes
Corresponding value in install.properties
Control plane nodes in the same
subnet
Hostname must resolve to the value specified in HA_VIRTUAL_IP
parameter
Control plane nodes are in different
subnets
Hostname must resolve to the value specified in
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST parameter

To use custom certificates, select 
Use custom certificates
. You get additional options to choose the certificate format.
When using custom certificates, you must import the Certification Authority (CA) certificates into the browser from where
you will log on to the Management Portal.
3
. 
Choose a certificate format.
If you choose the 
PKCS#1 or PKCS#8
 option:
1
. 
Select a 
CA certificate
. This is a root certificate.
2
. 
Select a 
Server certificate
. The supported certificate formats are: .crt, .cer, and .pem file.
3
. 
Select a key file. The supported private key formats are 
PKCS1
 and 
PKCS8
. For other formats, please convert
them to the supported formats. 
4
. 
Enter the private key password for the encrypted private key file. Don't use non-UTF-8 characters, such as "£".
The root certificate is the only root certificate that must be trusted and from the parent domain.
The server certificate must be a certificate chain. It must contain the origin server certificate (server.crt)
and all intermediate certificates. The root certificate/CA is optional for the server certificate.
The server certificate must be in the following sequence: the original server certificate, the intermediate
certificated, and the root certificate. Merge all the certificates into a certificate chain.
If you didn't specify the private key password, the OMT installer will use the PKCS#12 file password as a
key password.
If you choose the 
PKCS#12
 option:
1
. 
Choose a CA .crt file for a CA certificate.
2
. 
Select a .pfx file for the PKCS#12 file.
3
. 
Enter the PKCS#12 file password. Don't use non-UTF-8 characters, such as "£".
4
. 
Enter the private key password. Don't use non-UTF-8 characters, such as "£".
You can also update the certificates on the Management Portal after the installation. Click 
NEXT
.
Add control plane nodes
1
. 
If you have specified a value for the 
HA_VIRTUAL_IP
 or 
LOAD_BALANCER_HOST
 parameter in the install.properties file, the
Master High Availability
 option is available. To configure more than one control plane node, select the 
Make master
highly available
 option. Otherwise, click 
NEXT
 to add worker nodes.
2
. 
Provide the following information on the 
Add Master Node
 page:
Note:
 Usually you should ensure that you've stored the hostname (FQDN) in the Common Name (CN) field
and the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of the certificate. However, if the access to the cluster is
through an application load balancer, the certificate can't contain the hostname. In that case, you can skip
the pop-up warning message and keep on deploying.
