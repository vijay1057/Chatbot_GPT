Service Portal
OCTCR19M1605295

You have an offering and its User options tab defines an entity link field.
Then, on the Request default values tab, you use a DSL expression that
contains this entity link field to set a field’s value. When you try to use
this offering to create a request in the Service Portal, if the entity link
field has a value, the request creation fails. To work around this issue,
use a Set field business rule on the offering’s Rules tab instead of setting
the value on the Request default values tab.
