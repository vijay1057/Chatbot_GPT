If you plan to install the containerized CMS (as the next deployment on the same OMT), use the following guidelines to
determine the additional hardware resources required for CMS.
1. Determine the deployment size
When installing CMS, you will need to select a deployment size: Small, Medium, or Large, so that the CMS deployment is
automatically scaled according to the selected size. Use the following table to determine your deployment size.
Deployment size 
Small
Medium
Large
Maximum number of CIs and Relationships in CMDB
10 million
30 million
200 million
2. Determine the hardware resource requirements
The following table lists the minimum resources needed for setting up a CMS environment in the cloud with high
availability.
A standard deployment includes control plane nodes (owned by AWS), worker nodes, EFS as storage, and RDS as
databases.

The sizes are for your reference only. They may vary depending on your ticket size, user access rate, integrations, and so
on.
Plan resources for OData integration 
Before starting to use the OData integration, please read 
Sizing guide for OData integration
 to determine if you need
additional Datahub pods, read-only platform pods, and additional worker nodes.
Note
 For EBS backend storage, including EBS backend storage used for OS storage and overlay2, and EBS
backend RDS services, you may switch to IO1 instead of GP2 for better performance. For more details,
see 
EBS storage
 and 
RDS Storage
