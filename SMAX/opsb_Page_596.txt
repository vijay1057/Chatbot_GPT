Ensure Ports Are Available
Verify that ports required by 
Vertica
 are not in use by running the following command as the root user and comparing it with
the ports required, as shown below:
netstat -atupn
If you are using a Red Hat 7/CentOS 7 system, use the following command instead:
ss -atupn
Firewall Requirements
Vertica
 requires several ports to be open on the local network. 
Vertica
 does not recommend placing a firewall between nodes
(all nodes should be behind a firewall), but if you must use a firewall between nodes, ensure the following ports are available:

Intra- and inter-cluster communication. 
Vertica
 opens the 
Vertica
 client port +1 (5434 by
default) for intra-cluster communication, such as during a plan. 
If the port +1 from the
default client port is not available, then 
Vertica
 opens a random port for intra-cluster
communication.
