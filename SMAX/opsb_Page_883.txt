Create ECR repositories
Before pushing images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), you need to create a repository for each image. Make sure
the 
create_aws_repositories.py
 script is saved to 
OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
 on the bastion (see 
Create ECR repositories
).
Then, run the following command on the bastion to create ECR repositories in a preferred region:
python create_aws_repositories.py -r <ecr_region> -o hpeswitom -i ./image-set.json
Where:
<ecr_region>
 is the region where you will put your ECR repositories and it can be different from the region you selected to
place all the prepared AWS resources.

. 
Copy the "smax-image-transfer.py" file from the 
Cloud Deployment x.x.x/byok
 directory to 
OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts.
2
. 
Run the following commands to retrieve the username and password of EC.
If you've installed AWS CLI version 1 when 
configuring the bastion
:
cd OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
dockerLogin=$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region <ecr_region>)
ecrUserName=$(echo $dockerLogin | awk '{print $4}')
ecrUserPassword=$(echo $dockerLogin | awk '{print $6}')
ecrURL=$(echo $dockerLogin | awk '{print $7}' | awk -F/ '{print $3}')
If you've installed AWS CLI version 2 when 
configuring the bastion
:
cd OMT_External_K8s_202x.xx-xxx/scripts
ecrUserName=AWS
ecrUserPassword=$(aws ecr get-login-password)
ecrURL=<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
3
. 
Run the following command to transfer images from the source registry to your own registry. 
 python3 smax-image-transfer.py -sr <source_registry> -su <source_username> -sp <source_password> -so <source_orgname> -tr <target_registry> -tu <target_username> -tp <target_password> -to <target_orgname> 
Where:
<ecr_region>
 is the region where you specified to put your ECR repositories.
<source_username>
 is the user name of the source docker registry. Obtain it from 
Micro Focus
 if you use Docker Hub,
or contact the admin of the registry.
<source_password>
 is the password of the source docker registry. Obtain it from 
Micro Focus
 if you use Docker Hub, or
contact the admin of the registry.
<source_registry>
 is the URL of the source registry. For example, 
registry.hub.docker.com
.
<source_orgname>
 is the organization name in the source docker registry. It's 
hpeswitom
 if you use Docker Hub, or
contact the admin of the registry.
<target_orgname>
 is the organization name in the target docker registry, which can be obtained from the admin of the
registry.
Note
  Python 3 is required to run the Python script below. Make sure Python 3 is installed on the bastion.
