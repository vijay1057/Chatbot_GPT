Click on the column header, then select the Data Type dropdown. Select Date/Time, then save the window.
The newly created readable time field is now selectable and will show the date in readable format.
Filters can now be applied to display the results required. As an example, a filter on the offering “Demo Repair my PC
hardware” will only show those requests, including the next target time (if exists) and status (which would indicate achieved or
breached). Similar filters can be applied to the service or assignment group.
