Configure load balancer for Audit service
To access Audit service, you need to create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and configure the listener for Audit service on
this ALB. The diagram below depicts how the integration ALB sets up the connection between SMAX and Audit:
Prerequisites
Before creating and configuring an ALB, assign an FQDN for Audit service (for example, via 
AWS route 53 services
) if you don't
have one. You also need to prepare a new certificate using one of the following methods or else unexpected errors might occur
at later steps.
