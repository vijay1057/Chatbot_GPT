For each tenant, the maximum number of concurrent jobs is 3.
For multiple tenants, at most 15 jobs can run at the same time.
When you enable the SAM capability for more than 5 tenants, the
maximum number of concurrent jobs is equal to or larger than 18 (6
x 3). In this case, you need to schedule the calculation jobs so that
less than 15 jobs are running at the same time.

How to calculate your SAM deployment size
Follow these steps to choose an appropriate SAM profile:
1
. 
Choose the maximum number of installed software applications that you want to calculate such as Windows Server and
Windows Desktop OS, which usually have the largest volume size in a production environment.
You can use the 
INSTALLED SOFTWARE
 report on the dashboard of CMS UI to learn about the total number of your
installed software, as shown in the following figure.
 
 
2
. 
Run calculation jobs separately for products of large volume sizes. By default, SAM supports three concurrent jobs.
For example, if you have 200,000 (0.2 M) per tenant devices deployed with Windows Desktop OS, you can choose either of the
following options:
Option 1: Schedule calculation jobs for Windows Desktop OS separately
Option 2: Schedule three concurrent calculation jobs for three products that have the same volume size as Windows
Desktop OS
Single tenant mode:

Option 2

Multi-tenancy mode: 
For 5 or more tenants, assume all tenants run calculation jobs for Windows Desktop OS at the same time:
