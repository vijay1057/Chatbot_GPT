Deploy the suite on Azure
This section provides information required to install and configure the 
Service Management Automation (SMA) suite 
on
Azure, including the preparation, installation, and setup tasks.
In addition to the 
SMA
 capability, you can also install and enable the following add-on capabilities. For each new installation,
the 
SMA
 capability is mandatory, and the rest are optional.

Description
Service
Manager
Portal Service
(SMPS)
Services required to integrate an external Service Manager system with SMA Service Portal.
Design and
Deploy (DND)
SMAX Cloud Management offers the DND capability. The DND capability enables customers to make
new cloud service offerings based on published service designs available to consumers.
Cost
Governance
and Resource
Optimization
(CGRO)
CGRO enables you to optimize your cloud spending and simplify configuration with various Cloud
providers. 
The CGRO installation has a dependency on DND. If you select CGRO, you must select DND as well.
Software
Asset
Management
(SAM)
With the hardware and software data discovered by UD and license data retrieved from SMAX, the
new SAM capability enables you to calculate and analyze license compliance for the software
applications that you are using in your organization. This will reduce the risk of noncompliance and
improve the visibility into your financial and operational decisions.
To install these add-on capabilities, use one of the following methods.
select the add-on capabilities from the installation portal during the suite installation (see step 2 in the 
Install the
suite 
section).
install the add-on capabilities on top of an existing suite instance (see the 
Install add-on capabilities
 section).
In addition, you can optionally install and enable the 
Native Service Asset & Configuration Management
 
(SACM)
solution after the suite deployment (see the 
Enable Native SACM
 section). Native SACM is one single solution for the entire
Service Asset & Configuration Management process with instant access to the data and embedded graphical widgets for CI
topology representation. 
If you want to use Native SACM in an Azure environment, please contact the support
team.
Before you begin, ensure that you 
have the deployment architecture planned
