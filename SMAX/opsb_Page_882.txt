Download and upload container images for CMS (FIPS
mode)
Before you deploy the suite, you need to download the required images from Docker Hub or other registries and then upload
the images to your registry.
Generate the Image Set
Before downloading and uploading the images, you need to generate the image set with the following steps on the bastion
node:
1
. 
Run the following command to navigate to the CMS helm chart directory of the downloaded CMS helm chart package:
cd <CMS helm chart directory>
For example:
cd CMS_Helm_Chart-202x.xx/cms-helm-charts
2
. 
Copy the following content to a text editor such as Notepad without any auto-formatting, and then change the CMS helm
chart package name (
cms-1.x.0+20xx0x00.xx.tgz 
in the command) to the exact name of the package:
cat ./samples/values-fips-with-smax.yaml > gdb_tmp.yaml
cat << EOF >> gdb_tmp.yaml
secrets:
  idm_db_password:  clear=dummy_password
  idm_admin_admin_password:  clear=dummy_password
  idm_sysadmin_admin_password:  clear=dummy_password
  autopass_db_password:  clear=dummy_password
  ucmdb_server_db_password:  clear=dummy_password
  ucmdb_probe_pg_root_password:  clear=dummy_password
  ucmdb_probe_pg_probe_password:  clear=dummy_password
  ITOM_DB_PASSWD_KEY:  clear=dummy_password
EOF
sed -i 's/externalAccessHost: ""/externalAccessHost: "dummy.com"/g' gdb_tmp.yaml
sed -i 's/acceptEula: false/acceptEula:  true/g' gdb_tmp.yaml
sed -i 's/dbName:/dbName:  dummydb/g' gdb_tmp.yaml
sed -i 's/idmAuthUrl:/idmAuthUrl:  dummy.com/g' gdb_tmp.yaml
$CDF_HOME/tools/generate-download/generate_download_bundle.sh -C ./charts/
cms-1.x.0+20xx0x00.xx.tgz
 -H gdb_tmp.yaml -S
3
. 
Paste the content that you updated in step 2 to the command line, and then press 
Enter
 to run the commands.
After executing the commands, the system displays the following messages indicating that you have successfully
generated the 
offline-download.zip
 file in the current working directory:
2023-01-05 18:12:59 INFO generate offline-download.zip from ./charts/cms-1.x.0+20xx0x00.xx.tgz  
2023-01-05 18:12:59 INFO Rendering chart..................................................... [OK]
2023-01-05 18:13:09 INFO offline-download.zip is generated under /CMS_Helm_Chart-202x.xx/cms-helm-charts  
2023-01-05 18:13:09 INFO For more details, please refer: /opt/cdf/log/generate_download_bundle/generate_download_bundle.20230105181259.log 
The 
offline-download.zip
 file contains a list of the required images and will be used when you run the Python script to
transfer the suite images in the later step.
After you successfully run the commands, you can delete the 
gdb_tmp.yaml 
file. 
4
. 
Unzip the 
offline-download.zip
 file and copy the 
/offline-download/image-set.json 
file to the 
<
OMT_External_K8s_2
Note
 If you have already uploaded images to your registry, skip this step.
Note:
 To follow the steps in this section, you must have installed the 
zip
 Linux command on the node where you
run the 
generate_download_bundle.sh
 script.
Note
: Only update the helm chart package name and keep the rest of the content as is. For the secrets
part, you don't need to specify any real password at the moment and "clear=dummy_password" is just used
as a placeholder value to pass the download bundle check.
