During the development cycle, the Helm chart is constructed so that when the development cycle is complete, the new version
of the suite is described by it.
The Helm chart is then provided as a download and the downloaded archive can be fed into OMT AppHub or Helm CLI.
Suite metadata
An ITOM suite is described by suite metadata. The metadata describes the composition of a suite and a set of runtime
requirements such as volumes for persistent storage. The figure below shows the setup.
During the development cycle, the suite metadata is constructed so that when the development cycle is complete, the new
version of the suite is described by it.
The metadata is then provided as a download and the downloaded archive can be fed into the installer.
Obtaining container images
