Alternatively, change the owner for each NFS directory. For example: 
chown -R 1999:1999 /var/vols/itom/core
...
chown -R 1999:1999 /var/vols/itom/itsma-smarta-sawmeta-con-a-1

. 
In the 
/etc/exports
 file, export the NFS directories. 
If you're using the same base directory for all NFS volumes, add one line for the base directory: 
<base directory> *
(rw,sync,anonuid=1999,anongid=1999,root_squash)
. For example:
/var/vols/itom *(rw,sync,anonuid=1999,anongid=1999,root_squash)
Alternatively, add the following line for each NFS directory: 
<NFS volume export path> *(rw,sync,anonuid=
<SYSTEM_USER_ID>,anongid=<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID>,root_squash
). For example:
/var/vols/itom/core *(rw,sync,anonuid=1999,anongid=1999,root_squash)
...
/var/vols/itom/itsma-smarta-sawmeta-con-a-1 *(rw,sync,anonuid=1999,anongid=1999,root_squash)

Run the following command:
exportfs -ra

Check the exported NFS volumes:
showmount -e

We strongly recommend that you limit access to the exported NFS directories to a specific host or hosts in a subnet. All control
plane nodes and worker nodes must have the access to the exported NFS directories. To do this, follow these steps:
1
. 
On the NFS server, open the 
/etc/exports
 file, and then add the following line for each exported directory to which you want
to limit access:
<path to shared directory> <host IP1>(rw,sync,anonuid=<SYSTEM_USER_ID>,anongid=<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID>,root_squash)
<path to shared directory> <host IP2>(rw,sync,anonuid=<SYSTEM_USER_ID>,anongid=<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID>,root_squash)
For example, you add the following line:
/var/vols/itom/core 192.0.0.2(rw,sync,anonuid=1999,anongid=1999,root_squash)
/var/vols/itom/core 192.0.0.3(rw,sync,anonuid=1999,anongid=1999,root_squash)
You can also allow hosts in a specific subnet to access the exported NFS directories. To do this, add the following line for
each exported directory to which you want to limit access:
 
<shared directory1> <IP of subnet host>(rw,sync,anonuid=<SYSTEM_USER_ID>,anongid=<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID>,root_squash)
<shared directory2>; <IP of subnet host>(rw,sync,anonuid=<SYSTEM_USER_ID>,anongid=<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID>,root_squash)
For example, you add the following line:
/var/vols/itom/itom-logging-vol 192.0.2.0/16(rw,sync,anonuid=1999,anongid=1999,root_squash)
/var/vols/itom/core 192.0.2.0/16(rw,sync,anonuid=1999,anongid=1999,root_squash)
2
. 
Save the 
/etc/exports
 file, and then run the following command: 
exportfs -r
Each time you add a new node to the cluster, make sure the IPv4 address or hostname of this node is in the allowable address
list to grant the node access to the shares.
Important
 For best security, we strongly recommend that you limit access to exported NFS folders by
replacing * in the configuration lines with specific IP addresses as described in the "Limit access to the
exported NFS folders" section below.
