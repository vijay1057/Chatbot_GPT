Manage Person API URL
The Manage Person API URL uses the format https://<MasterNode>/rest/<tenantId>/ums/managePersons. To access the API
using the Postman REST client, set the action to ‘POST’ and enter the URL, then add the relevant information to the body of
the request. 
Configuring the upnDataType field
The Manage Person API uses the UPN field to identify person records. The UPN field is a unique identifier and is by default the
email address of the person. In some cases, this is not the desired behavior. If the email is not going to be the UPN then on
every use of the Manage Person API to post data the upnDataType needs to be used. In the JSON payload the field name
should appear as: "upnDataType":"Customer_UID" (see examples below)
Adding a Contact
When adding a person to Service Management Automation X, it is important to determine whether they should be added as a
contact or a user. The difference is that a user has the right to log in to the system whereas a contact does not.
To add a contact, enter all desired attributes and then add the “IsMaasUser”: “false” flag. If IsMaasUser is not set to false the
system will create a user instead of a contact.
