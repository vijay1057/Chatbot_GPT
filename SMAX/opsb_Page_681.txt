. 
Extract the .zip package to a directory.

. 
Set up the HTTP/HTTPS proxy, if you can't access the image registry. For example, you can run the following commands to
set the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Replace the placeholders with your actual server and port. 
export http_proxy="<http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"
export https_proxy="<https://PROXY_SERVER:PORT>"

. 
Log in to the node where you place the 
offline-download.zip
 file. Then go to the directory into which you extracted the 
offline-
download.zip
 package.
6
. 
Run the following command:
 
./downloadimages.sh [-r <image repository URL>][-u <username>][-d <image download directory>] [-c on|off] [-o <org name>]
Where:
<image repository URL>: Specify the 
-r
 option if you want to download the images from a repository other than
Docker Hub.
Replace <
username
> with the Docker Hub username.
If you don't specify the credentials here, you will be prompted to specify them when you run the command.
<image download directory>: The directory where the container images will be downloaded. The default value is
/var/opt/cdf/offline.
The 
-c
 option is used to verify the digital signature of the images during the download. The default setting is off,
which doesn't verify the signature.
<org name>
: The organization in the image registry that contains the images for installation. By default, this is 
hpeswit
om.
 This option is mandatory if you aren't using the default organization name.
To see the full list of options for the downloadimages.sh command, run the following command:
./downloadimages.sh –h
The command also has a 
-p
 option to provide your password. The 
-p
  option doesn't support single quotes (that is, don't
include single quotes in the password).
The download process may take several hours, depending on your selections and the Internet connection speed. In the
meantime, you can close this window and return later.
Transfer the images to the control plane node
This step is only required if the control plane node can't access Docker Hub. Follow the instructions on 
Transfer container
images
 page to transfer the downloaded images to a specified image directory on the control plane node. Then, click 
NEXT
.
Upload the images

. 
Log on to one of the control plane nodes.
2
. 
On the control plane node, go to the 
$CDF_HOME/scripts/
 directory. Run the following command:
cd $CDF_HOME/scripts
3
. 
Run the following command to upload the suite images to the local registry:
./uploadimages.sh [-u <username>]  [-d <image download directory>] [-o <org name>]
Where:
Replace <
username
> with the registry username.  Use the "registry-admin" user for the local registry. The local
registry refers to the default registry or the registry URL that's "localhost:5000."
If you don't specify the credentials here, you will be prompted to specify them when you run the command.
<image download directory>: The directory where the container images will be downloaded. The default value is
/var/opt/cdf/offline. The 
-d
 option is the image directory where you placed the images you have downloaded. Specify
the 
-d 
option if the images aren't available in the 
/var/opt/cdf/offline/
 directory. You can use the 
-d
 option multiple

By selecting the -p option, you are disabling or bypassing security features, thereby exposing the system to
increased security risks. By using this option, you understand and agree to assume all associated risks and hold

Note
: The images will be uploaded by the 
uploadimages.sh
 script later. The image upload requires up to 2 times of
the image size space in the target image directory. For example, if you choose to use the
default 
/var/opt/cdf/offline
 directory, ensure that you have 2 times of the OMT and suite image size space under 
/var
/opt/cdf/offline
 directory of the control plane node.
