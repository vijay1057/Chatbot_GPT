Subscribe premium Azure Files and Azure Disks
This release supports 
NetApp Files
 or 
Azure Files & Azure Disks
 as the storage service on Azure.
Due to the unstable performance of Azure Files, it's highly recommended that you deploy the suite using NetApp Files
(see 
Subscribe NetApp Files
).
If you still plan to use Azure Files & Azure Disks as the storage service, you need to:
1
. 
Create an Azure file share and configure the volumes to store the 
generic
 data (all data of OMT and the suite except
search engine and RabbitMQ). 
Make sure you test the performance before proceeding 
(see step 4 in the 
Configure
volumes
 section below).
2
. 
Create a StorageClass for Azure Disks to store the
 search engine and RabbitMQ
 data. During installation, persistent
volumes belonging to this class will be provisioned dynamically and corresponding Azure Disks will be automatically
created. 
Create premium Azure file share
Role

Storage administrator
Bastion node
To create and configure premium Azure file share, log on to the bastion and follow these steps:
1
. 
Run the following command to create a FileStorage account:
az storage account create \
    --resource-group <resource_group_name> \
    --name <storage_account_name> \
    --location <location> \
    --sku Premium_LRS \
    --kind FileStorage
In this command,
<resource_group_name>
 is the name of the resource group you created on the 
Build AKS cluster
 page. Do 
NOT
 use
your cluster's resource group name with the format 
MC_<resource_group>_<aks_cluster_name>_<location>
.
<storage_account_name>
: Define a name for this FileStorage account.
<location>
 is the location of the created resource group. For example, 
westus2
.
2
. 
Run the following command to get the key of the created FileStorage account:
az storage account keys list \
    --resource-group <resource_group_name> \
    --account-name <storage_account_name> \
    --query "[0].value" | tr -d '"'
In this command,
<resource_group_name>
 is the name of the resource group you created on the 
Build AKS cluster
 page. Do 
NOT
 use
your cluster's resource group name with the format 
MC_<resource_group>_<aks_cluster_name>_<location>
.
<storage_account_name>
 is the name of the created FileStorage account.
3
. 
Create an Azure file share for storing the 
generic
 data (all data of OMT and the suite except search engine and
RabbitMQ) by running the following command.
az storage share create \
--account-name <storage_account_name> \
--account-key <storage_account_key> \
--name "<fileshare_name>" \
--quota <share_quota>
In this command,
<storage_account_name>
 is the name of the created FileStorage account.
<storage_account_key>
 is the key you got in the previous step.
<fileshare_name>
: Specify a name for the Azure file share to store the 
generic
 data.
<share_quota>
: Specify the size of the share (
in GB
) by referring to 
Sizing recommendations
. Must be greater than 0,
and less than or equal to 5 TB (5120).
