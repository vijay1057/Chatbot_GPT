Launch EKS cluster worker nodes for CMS
This task is required only when you need to install CMS. See 
Sizing guides (EKS)
 for information about the additional EKS
cluster worker nodes required to deploy CMS.
To launch EKS cluster worker nodes, repeat the 
previous task
 as you performed to launch EKS cluster worker nodes for the
suite.
The only difference is that you need to use the following label for CMS in 
Kubernetes labels
 when adding the node group.
Key
Value
Worker
cms
Role
loadbalancer
After you create the worker nodes for CMS, you can run the following command to check whether the 
cms 
label is successfully
assigned to the worker nodes:
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
Review the output to see if you can see
 
Worker:cms
 as the label for the worker nodes.
