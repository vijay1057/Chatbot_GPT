To set up OO with a common database, you can choose to connect OO to the same database instance as the rest of the
suite components. For hardware requirements, see the table below 
Standard hardware requirements with a
common database.
Important:
OO supports the database servers recommended by the rest of the suite components (that is, Standard D8S_V3), and
if you choose to connect OO to the same database server as the rest of the suite components, make sure the
common database server sums up both OO and the suite requirements. 
OO shares the same 
AFS
 server with the suite.
To determine standard hardware requirements with a dedicated database for OO, see 
Additional hardware
requirements for OO Containerized with a dedicated database
 section.
To deploy OO for a 5-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here
.
To deploy OO for a 20-tenant support, use the 
oo_size_values.yaml
 file provided 
here

* This is the minimum resources requirements for the deployment. According to the sizing definition benchmark results, our lab
tests indicate the average CPU utilization is 40 ~ 60%, and the memory utilization is 60 ~ 75%. If one node is down, it may
cause services to be unavailable. From node high availability consideration, it's recommended that you add at least one
additional node or more depending on your actual environments such as ticket size, user access rate, and integrations.
#The 
max_connections
 value for the combined database should be equal to or greater than 3400.
