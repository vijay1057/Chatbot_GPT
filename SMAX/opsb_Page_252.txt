The SAM Home screen gives an overview of the potential costs that a company could incur for license overspend or show what
products are at risk due to not enough licenses. When an Agent uses SAM for the first time, the home screen will not display
any data. Once the system calculates the license usage, the widgets are populated.  The data is driven by UCMDB discovery
linked with Software Licenses that are created within SMAX. SAM can then join this data together and perform calculations to
see how the discovery data fits the license rules defined in the Software License model.
When navigating between screens, the agent uses the top menu to access the appropriate parts of SAM.
This document contains a worked example of how to use each area of SAM to create a working Software License and show a
Compliance result,  then analyze the findings. It’s essential to follow the document in the order it is written to ensure the
required results.

From the Products page, both On-Premise and SaaS products can be viewed.
The first time SAM is used there will be no products listed for On-Premise.
At this point the agent must click 
Sync from CMS
, which will take some time depending on how many Installed Software CIs
are held in UCMDB.
Once the Sync has completed, there should be a full list of products shown:
