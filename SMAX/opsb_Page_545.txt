SMA + SAM + containerized CMS
Option 3. Install SMA +DND + OO + CGRO
Use this option if you plan to install the SMA together with the DND and CGRO capabilities (which the Cloud Management
functionality requires). 
The installation of 
Operations Orchestration(OO) Containerized
 is mandatory for 
DND
 to work. After installing DND,
install and enable OO Containerized. See 
Install OO on-premises
 and 
Enable OO Containerized
.
The following diagram illustrates the architecture of this deployment option. 
Installing and enabling OO Containerized should be completed before enabling DND in the suite administration.
