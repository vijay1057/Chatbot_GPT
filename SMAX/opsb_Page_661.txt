Component
NFS volume label
Description
Example export path
Supported NFS settings
The storage technology that provides NFS implementation must support the Kubernetes persistent mount option of
ReadWriteMany. That means you can mount a storage volume to multiple nodes in read/write mode in parallel. In an on-
premises environment, you can use one of the following storage types:
Self-hosted NFS storage
Managed NFS storage
The following table describes the supported NFS settings for each storage type.

rw
sync
The following permission configurations:
chmod -R 755 <path to the exported volume>
chown <SYSTEM_USER_ID>:<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID> <path to the exported volume>
The following line in the 
/etc/exports
 file:
<path to the shared folder on the NFS server> (rw,sync,anonuid=<SYSTEM_USER_ID>,anongid=<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID>,root_squash)
Supported
Supported
when the NFS
storage is
using
root_squash 
rw
sync
The following permission configuration:
chmod -R 755 <path to the exported volume>
chown <SYSTEM_USER_ID>:<SYSTEM_GROUP_ID> <path to the exported volume>
The following line in the 
/etc/exports
 file:
<path to the shared folder on the NFS server> (rw,sync,no_root_squash)
Not
supported
Supported
when the NFS
storage is
using
no_root_squash
Configure NFS shares if using self-hosted NFS storage

Notes
The UID and GID of the exported NFS folders are configured in the install.properties file through the
SYSTEM_USER_ID and SYSTEM_GROUP_ID parameters, both of which have a default value of 1999. You can
use 1999 or a custom value between 100000 and 2000000000 (for example, 100001 as the UID and 100002
as the GID). As an example,  the command lines below use 1999.  
You can use one or more NFS servers for OMT and the suite. The following example uses the same NFS
server for both OMT and the suite.
If you run antivirus software, backup software, or any other software that scans the file system on the
machine that hosts the NFS server, don't use the software to monitor the Smart Analytics NFS directory (for
example: <base directory>/smartanalytics-volume), because this will have a significant impact on the
performance of IDOL indexing and IDOL search.
