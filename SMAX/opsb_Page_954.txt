Configure load balancers for OO
Configure external ALB for OO
You can access OO from outside the Kubernetes cluster using an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB).
The diagram below depicts how to separate SMA and OO access through the two ALBs, while the communication between SMA
and OO happens through the integration ALB.
Prerequisites
Before creating and configuring an ALB:
Assign an FQDN for OO Load Balancer. For example, see 
AWS route 53 services
 if you don't have one.
The FQDN is a subdomain of the SMA FQDN.
For example, if SMA is FQDN is 
smax.example.com
, then OO FQDN is 
oo
.smax.example.com
.
Use a certificate for the ALB, which you can generate or import to AWS Certificates Manager. The target domain name (CN
name) of the certificate is the FQDN you will bind with the ALB in a later step.
You can prepare a certificate for this Load Balancer using one of the following methods:
Request a certificate
If you want to request a new certificate, follow these steps:
1
. 
Log in to the AWS Management Console in your target region.
2
. 
Navigate to 
All services
 > 
Security, Identity, & Compliance
 > 
Certificate Manager
.
3
. 
If the

 page that displays, click 
Get Started
.
4
. 
Click 
Request a certificate
.
5
. 
Select 
Request a public certificate
 and click 
Next.
6
. 
Specify your target domain name. Use an asterisk (*) to request a wildcard certificate to protect several sites in the same
domain. For example, 
*.testoo-conteinarized.org.
7
. 
Select 
DNS validation
 or 
Email validation
 according to your permission.
8
. 
Click 
Request
.
Note
: 
1
. 
The Integration ALB must be internal, you can access it only from the VPC.
2
. 
The two 'external' ALBs used for accessing SMA and OO can be either internal or internet facing, based on
your preference. 
The term 'external' here is to emphasize that these ALBs are routing only the traffic that comes from
outside the Kubernetes cluster.
