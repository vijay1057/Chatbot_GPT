In this release, FIPS mode support is under controlled availability, where Micro Focus will work with
customers to review the planned implementation. Installing the suite with FIPS mode enabled requires more
hardware resources than without FIPS mode enabled. Contact 
Micro Focus
 SMA Product Management before you
start the implementation.
