Writing User-friendly Articles: An Example
The following is a real example of a Knowledge Article before an after it was rewritten with the advice given above.
Article content before rewrite:
The Repository server allows only 
Micro Focus
 networks. To access this server we should use the 
Micro Focus
 intranet
network. If you are in a public network, you need to connect to the Pulse VPN first to access this server. Servers located in
all the Data Centers (including Trade and LabOPs) will be able to communicate to this repository server using respective
Data Center Proxies. If you want to access this server from 
Micro Focus
 office networks then no need to connect to any
VPN.
Article content after rewrite:
Access to the Repository server
- You can only access the repository server from the 
Micro Focus
 networks.
- If you are in a public network, connect to Pulse VPN first
Note: Servers located in all the Data Centers (including Trade and LabOPs) can communicate to this repository server using
respective Data Center Proxies.
The large block of text has been replaced with bullet points and a simple note, conveying the same information as the original
in a way that's easily consumed by the customer.
