Disk Space Requirements for Vertica
In addition to actual data stored in the database, Vertica requires disk space for several data reorganization operations, such
as 
mergeout
 and 
managing nodes
 in the cluster. For best results, Vertica recommends that disk utilization per node be no
more than sixty percent (60%) for a 
K-Safe=1
 database to allow such operations to proceed.
In addition, disk space is temporarily required by certain query execution operators, such as hash joins and sorts, in the case
when they cannot be completed in memory (RAM). Such operators might be encountered during queries, recovery, refreshing
projections, and so on. The amount of disk space needed (known as 
temp space
) depends on the nature of the queries,
amount of data on the node and number of concurrent users on the system. By default, any unused disk space on the data
disk can be used as temp space. However, Vertica recommends provisioning temp space separate from data disk space.
