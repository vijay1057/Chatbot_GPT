Firewall Considerations
Vertica
 requires multiple ports be open between nodes. You may use a firewall (IP Tables) on Redhat/CentOS and
Ubuntu/Debian based systems. Note that firewall use is not supported on SuSE systems and that SuSE systems must disable
the firewall. The installer reports issues found with your IP tables configuration with the identifiers 
N0010
 for (systems that
use IP Tables) and 
N011
 (for SuSE systems).
The installer checks the IP tables configuration and issues a warning if there are any configured rules or chains. The installer
does not detect if the configuration may conflict with 
Vertica
. It is your responsibility to verify that your firewall allows traffic
for 
Vertica
 as described in 
Ensure Ports Are Available
.
You can modify your firewall to allow for 
Vertica
 network traffic, or you can disable the firewall if your network is secure. Note
that firewalls are not supported for 
Vertica
 systems running on SuSE.
Red Hat 6 and CentOS 6 Systems
For details on how to configure iptables and allow specific ports to be open, see the platform-specific documentation for your
platform:
RedHat: 
https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/sect-
Security_Guide-IPTables.html
CentOS: 
http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/IPTables
To disable iptables, run the following command as root or sudo:
# service iptables save
# service iptables stop
# chkconfig iptables off
To disable iptables if you are using the ipv6 versions of iptables, run the following command as root or sudo:
# service ip6tables save
# service ip6tables stop
# chkconfig ip6tables off
Red Hat 7 and CentOS 7 Systems:
To disable the system firewall, run the following command as root or sudo:
# systemctl mask firewalld
# systemctl disable firewalld
# systemctl stop firewalld
Ubuntu and Debian Systems
For details on how to configure iptables and allow specific ports to be open, see the platform-specific documentation for your
platform:
Debian: 
https://wiki.debian.org/iptables
Ubuntu: 
https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/firewall.html
.
Note
The installer does not check NAT entries in iptables.

You may encounter the 
N0010
 issue even when the firewall is disabled. If this occurs, you can workaround this
issue and install Vertica by ignoring installer WARN messages. To do this, install (or update) with a failure
threshold of FAIL. For example,
 /opt/vertica/sbin/install_vertica --failure-threshold FAIL <other install options...>
.
Note
Ubuntu uses the ufw program to manage iptables.
