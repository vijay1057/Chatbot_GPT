    -----END CERTIFICATE----- 
For each certificate, the key index name represents the name of the certificate. In the example, 
smax_lb.crt 
is the
certificate used for SMA Application Load Balancer and 
oo_db.crt 
is the certificate used for the RDS instance OO
connects to, only if its configured with a TLS connection. 
Make sure to use the correct indentation. For example:
caCertificates
 is the top level key index, therefore there is no need for any indentation before the parameter name. 
smax_lb.crt
 is a second level key index, therefore you must use 2 spaces for indentation.
----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE -----
 is the content of the 
PEM
 encoded certificate. Indent each line by 4 spaces.
Monitoring parameters
You can add monitoring support by exposing Prometheus style metrics from the most critical OO services (OO Controller, OO
Central, OO Scheduler, OO UI, and OO Downloader). This helps in troubleshooting various aspects inside the cluster like
performance, scalability, and others. For information on enabling monitoring using Prometheus in OPTIC Management Toolkit
(OMT), see 
Enable the monitoring capability
. After enabling OMT monitoring capability, you must configure OO to deploy the
service monitors.
The OO service monitors are deployed when you set the 
global.prometheus.deployPrometheusConfig
 user input
parameter to 
true
.
Parameter
Required
Description
Default
Example
global.prometh
eus.deployProm
etheusConfig
No
Controls whether to deploy
scraping rules through 
ServiceM
onitor
 objects and alerts
through
 
PrometheusRule
 objects
true
This input depends on whether you have enabled the
monitoring capability.
global.prometh
eus.deployGraf
anaConfig
No
Controls whether to deploy 
Con
figMap
 objects
containing 
Grafana
 dashboard
configurations
true
ConfigMaps
 labeled 
grafana_dashboard:
"1"
 contain dashboard configurations. OMT
monitoring solution uploads these dashboards
in 
Grafana
. For other monitoring solutions download
and upload the dashboards into 
Grafana 
manually.
global.prometh
eus.prometheus
Selector.promet
heus_config
No
Defines the label (s) that apply
to the scraping rules through 
S
erviceMonitor
 objects
1
Based on this label, you can include or exclude
metrics from Prometheus.
global.prometh
eus.grafanaSele
ctor.grafana_da
shboard
No
Defines the label(s) that apply
to the 
Grafana
 dashboard
configurations through 
ConfigMa
p
 objects
1
The default label value used by the OMT monitoring
solution. For a custom Grafana solution use the
appropriate configuration label.
Create and configure oo_size_values.yaml file
This additional file indicates the size of OO in terms of the amount of resources each OO component utilizes.
This configuration is mandatory.
Support for configuring up to five tenants
The below configuration enables OO to support up to five tenants.
Copy and save the following as 
oo_size_values.yaml 
at the same location as the main 
values.yaml 
file if you want to
deploy OO with support of up to five tenants:
global:
  deploymentType: install
oocentral:
  deployment:
    replicas: 1
    # JVM Heap memory usage
    initMemory: 4096
    maxMemory: 4096
    # CPU usage
    cpuRequest: 1000
    cpuLimit: 2000
    # Container memory request/limit
