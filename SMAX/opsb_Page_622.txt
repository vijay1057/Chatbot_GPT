Root
If you chose to use the default root user for installation, you can skip this topic. If you chose to use a non-root user for
installation, you should follow this topic.
You must use credentials with root user permissions to proceed with the installation. A root user must enable a set of
commands for the non-root users to get the privileges of installing OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT). 
Configure sudo access for non-root users
This step is optional. You must perform the following steps if you will perform the installation with non-root users.
To grant installation permissions to the non-root users, perform the following steps on all control plane nodes and worker
nodes:
1
. 
Log on to the node as the root user.
2
. 
Open the 
/etc/sudoers
 file with a supported editor. You can either enable the 
/etc/sudoers
 file write permissions or use some
editor that can edit some read-only files to edit this file. For example, 
vim
.  Then add the following lines to the end of the
file.
On the first control plane node:
Cmnd_Alias CDFINSTALL = <OMT installation package directory>/scripts/pre-check.sh,  <OMT installation package directory>/install, <OMT installation package directory>/node_prereq, <OMT_HOME>/uninstall.sh, <OMT_HOME>/bin/cdfctl, <OMT_HOME>/scripts/cdfctl.sh, <OMT_HOME>/bin/jq, <OMT_HOME>/tools/generate-download/generate_download_bundle.sh, /usr/bin/kubectl, /usr/bin/mkdir, /usr/bin/cp, /usr/bin/helm, /bin/rm, /bin/chmod, /bin/tar, <OMT_HOME>/scripts/uploadimages.sh, /bin/chown
<username> ALL=NOPASSWD: CDFINSTALL
Defaults:<username> env_keep += "CDF_HOME", !requiretty
Replace 
<
OMT installation package directory
>
 with the directory where you unzip the installation package. For example: 
/
tmp/OMT_Embedded_K8s_202X.XX.XXXX
.
Replace 
<
OMT_HOME
>
 with the path to the OMT directory (typically, this is 
/opt/cdf
). In a later installation step, you
will add this value to the install.properties file.
Replace 
<
username
>
 with the user name of the sudo user.
Replace all the placeholders that are wrapped in the pointy brackets '<>' with the actual values. Note that
"CDF_HOME" in the last line is not a placeholder. Don't replace it with any other value. 
On all other control plane and worker nodes:
Cmnd_Alias CDFINSTALL = <temp_directory>/pre-check.sh,  <temp_directory>/ITOM_Suite_Foundation_Node/install, <Path to node_prereq script>/node_prereq, <OMT_HOME>/uninstall.sh, <OMT_HOME>/bin/cdfctl, <OMT_HOME>/scripts/cdfctl.sh, <OMT_HOME>/tools/generate-download/generate_download_bundle.sh, /usr/bin/kubectl, /usr/bin/mkdir, /usr/bin/cp, /usr/bin/helm, /bin/rm, /bin/chmod, /bin/tar, <OMT_HOME>/scripts/uploadimages.sh, /bin/chown
<username> ALL=NOPASSWD: CDFINSTALL
Defaults:<username> env_keep += "CDF_HOME", !requiretty 
Replace 
<
temp_directory
>
 with the path to a temporary directory for the installation. In a later installation step, you
will add this value to the install.properties file. By default, this is 
/tmp
.
Replace 
<
OMT_HOME
>
 with the path to the Kubernetes directory (typically, this is 
/opt/cdf
). In a later installation step,
you will add this value to the install.properties file.
Replace 
<
username
>
 with the user name of the sudo user.
Replace all the placeholders that are wrapped in the pointy brackets '<>' with the actual values. Note that
"CDF_HOME" in the last line is not a placeholder. Don't replace it with any other value. 
3
. 
If you need to add additional commands, append them to the 
Cmnd_Alias CDFINSTALL
 line.
4
. 
Locate the 
secure_path
 line and make sure that the 
/sbin
, 
/bin
, 
/usr/sbin
, and 
/usr/bin
 paths are present, as shown below:
Defaults secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
By doing this, the sudo user can run the: 
showmount
, 
curl
, 
ifconfig
, and 
unzip
 commands when they install the product. If
the sudo user receives a permission error when they run a command during the installation process, verify that the
command exists in the 
sudoers
 file.
5
. 
The 
sudoers
 file might be overwritten by the configuration tools, such as Puppet, Chef, and Ansible. Make sure the 
sudoers
file contains all the configurations that grant the sudo user access.
After OMT installation, you will also need some of these permissions to perform administrative tasks, such as extending nodes.
If you aren't required to perform administrative tasks, you can remove the following commands. This is an optional step.
<OMT installation package directory>/scripts/pre-check.sh 
<OMT installation package directory>/install
/bin/rm
/usr/bin/mkdir
/bin/chmod
/usr/bin/cp
/bin/tar
/bin/chown
