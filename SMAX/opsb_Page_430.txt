The following table shows the highest level of HA that can be achieved depending in the installed configuration.

HA summary
An application service is highly available through a combination of the following individual techniques:
Host service monitoring and restart
Multiple cluster nodes
Containerd container restart policy
Kubernetes high availability configuration
Kubernetes container restart policy
Kubernetes liveness probe
Multiple instances
Using an embedded or external, highly-available database
Highly available storage
Host services monitoring
The following services are run directly on the host:
Containerd daemon
Kubernetes Kubelet
These processes run as systemd services and are monitored by the systemd services subsystem.
When these processes crash, they will be automatically restarted.
Multiple cluster nodes
Multiple cluster nodes increase the level of high availability. If a cluster node goes down, the workload can be moved to other
still functioning cluster nodes.
Kubernetes high availability
The Kubernetes project describes HA 
for Kubernetes
 requirements:
Multiple control plane and multiple worker nodes
A redundant, reliable data storage layer for Kubernetes
Replicated Kubernetes API servers
Multiple kube-DNS, controller, scheduler instances
Leader election for controller and scheduler components
Kubelet component on worker nodes talks to load-balanced control plane API server endpoint
The OMT embedded Kubernetes supports all of the above Kubernetes HA requirements, if the platform is installed with
multiple control plane nodes.
OMT AppHub high availability
See: 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/
These services also can be configured for various levels of HA:
Basic Kubernetes restart policy
Kubernetes liveness probes
Multiple instances
Kubernetes basic restart policy
Kubernetes will restart pods that crash. This can be influenced by configuring the restartPolicy setting in the pod specification.
Note
All foundational services have HA configuration or behavior.
