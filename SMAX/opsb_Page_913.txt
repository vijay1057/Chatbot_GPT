Verify the CMS installation (EKS) (FIPS)
To verify if CMS has been installed successfully, do the following:
1
. 
Log in to the bastion node.
2
. 
Run the following command to make sure that all CMS pods are ready.
kubectl get pod -n <
CMS NAMESPACE
> |grep -v 1/1|grep -v 2/2|grep -v 3/3|grep -v 4/4|grep -v Completed
Where:
<
CMS NAMESPACE
>
 is the namespace where you deploy the CMS chart.
This command returns a list of abnormal pods. When it returns no results, all CMS pods are ready.
3
. 
Check whether the CMS pods are assigned to your CMS worker nodes:
kubectl get pods -o wide -n 
<
CMS NAMESPACE
>
Note 
It takes around 30 minutes to stabilize.
