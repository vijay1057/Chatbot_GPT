The OMT installation requires a certain amount of free space on the control plane nodes and worker nodes to deploy the
services. To install OMT successfully, you must make sure the directories and devices of the cluster nodes have enough free
space. The following table lists the directories and devices that the OMT installer will check before the installation. 
You can use the default directories in the table below. You can also specify custom directories by configuring the related
parameters in the 
install.properties
 file or by specifying the necessary command line options when you run the install
command. 
Make sure you use the absolute path for the corresponding directory. The following table provides a reference for the
directories that are required on each of the servers and the required space.

To specify your own directory, modify
the CDF_HOME parameter in the
install.properties file

This is the OMT installation directory.
When the overlayfs storage driver is
used, this directory is where the
container and pod storage is going
to be located.
The disk usage will grow over time.

This directory includes the OMT
images and all the suite images.
The subdirectory
/offline/suite_images can be
removed after the suite images are
uploaded.
/tmp
To specify your own directory, follow
one of the steps below:
Modify the TMP_FOLDER
parameter in install.properties
Run the following command
during the installation:
./install.sh --tmp-folder

there. You can remove the files in
this folder once OMT is installed.

Directory structure for installation and runtime data
The following sections are a conceptual overview of the directory structure and storage space requirements to help you set up
a server or a virtual machine for the installation. All Linux systems use space under the root filesystem (“/”).
/ (root filesystem)
This is the root directory, which is used for various Linux operating system functions.
