Changes to the I/O scheduler made through the 
/sys
 directory only last until the system is rebooted, so you need to add the
commands that change the I/O scheduler to a startup script (such as those stored in 
/etc/init.d
, or though a command in 
/etc/rc.l
ocal
). You also need to use a separate command for each drive on the system whose scheduler you want to change.
For example, to make the configuration take effect immediately and add it to rc.local so it is used on subsequent reboots.
echo deadline > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
echo 'echo deadline > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler' >> /etc/rc.local
You may prefer to use this method of setting the I/O scheduler over using a boot parameter if your system has a mix of solid-
state and physical media drives, or has many drives that do not store 
Vertica
 catalog and data directories.
If you are using Red Hat 7.0 or CentOS 7.0 or higher, run the following command as root or sudo:
$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local
Configure the I/O Scheduler - Changing the Scheduler with a Boot Parameter
Use the 
elevator
 kernel boot parameter to change the default scheduler used by all disks on your system. This is the best
method to use if most or all of the drives on your hosts are of the same type (physical media or SSD) and will contain catalog
or data files. You can also use the boot parameter to change the default to the scheduler the majority of the drives on the
system need, then use the 
/sys
 files to change individual drives to another I/O scheduler. 
The format of the elevator boot
parameter is:
elevator=
schedulerName
Where 
schedulerName
 is 
deadline
, 
noop
, or 
cfq
. You set the boot parameter using your bootloader (grub or grub2 on most
recent Linux distributions). See your distribution's documentation for details on how to add a kernel boot parameter.
Note
For systems that do not support
 /etc/rc.local
, use the equivalent startup script that is run after the destination
runlevel has been reached. For example SuSE uses 
/etc/init.d/after.local

Note
On some Ubuntu/Debian systems, the last line in rc.local must be "
exit 0
". So you must manually add the following
line to 
etc/rc.local
 before the last line with 
exit 0
.
