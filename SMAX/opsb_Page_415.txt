Flannel
When the OMT installs and configures its embedded Kubernetes, it configures additional network fabric. OMT supports only the
Flannel network fabric.
Every host gets its own flannel daemon running which creates a subnet allocated in a preset range: 172.16.0.0/16 for
containers and 172.17.17.0/24 for Kubernetes services.
The subnet configuration is handed over to Kubernetes and the Containerd daemon which uses it to generate IP addresses for
its containers.
The subnet that Flannel generates is unique for cluster node. This guarantees that all Pods get a cluster-wide unique IP
address. The uniqueness is guaranteed by Flannel using Etcd to store the subnet definitions.
The Flannel subnet is passed onto the Containerd daemon using the --config=/path/to/containerd-config.toml option. This
happens at install time.
The subnet that Flannel generates doesn't change for a node during the node lifecycle. It persists across reboots.
OMT supports two flannel configuration modes:
host-gw
Packet forwarding via iptables rules set by flanneld
Packets not encapsulated
Requires layer 2 connectivity between nodes
Packet forwarding occurs at the physical layer ie NIC
Requires all cluster nodes to be in a single subnet
vxlan
Packet forwarding via Linux kernel VXLAN functionality
Creates a virtual L2 network over a physical L3 network.
Works by encapsulating L2 packet in an L3 packet.
Requires only the control plane nodes to be in the same subnet
