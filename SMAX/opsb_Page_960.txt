Install external OO components (EKS)
Operations Orchestration (OO) supports the following components:
OO External RAS
OO RAS enables execution in remote data centers and networks. The RAS interacts with Central and polls it for operations
to execute. Installation of external OO RAS is optional and depends on whether you need additional RASes apart from
what's already available when you install OO Central.
OO Workflow Designer
OO Workflow Designer is a web based environment for authoring flows, which is available as a standalone product that
you can deploy either on a Windows or Linux server. Installing OO Workflow Designer is optional and depends on your
requirement to author flows. You need to install the OO Workflow Designer as it's not installed along with OO Central.
