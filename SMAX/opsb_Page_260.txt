SMAX will create a Task to run in the background. SAM will then run a calculation using the License details, the License Model,
the License Rules, and the number of Discovered pieces of software to determine how the product is being used across the
infrastructure.
A notification at the top of the screen to let the Agent know if the calculation was successful or not.
When the row is highlighted, it is also possible to click on Schedule so the Agent can choose how often to calculate usage. For
this action, a cron expression is required. For details, see 
Calculate license consumption
.
Once the calculation returns as successful, the agent can go to the Compliance screen on the top menu of Software Asset
Management. The Compliance screen will show all the Software Licenses in SAM with a Status of either Compliant or
Noncompliant, as shown below:
In this example, the agent see that the McAfee VirusScan is Compliant, there is one version of the software, and how much it
costs to have this product on the network.
The Agent can click on the McAfee VirusScan product to see greater detail around how this product is being used.
