Tuning configurations
​​​
Ingress and xruntime-ui tuning
When you use Azure Files as the storage service and login or other operations are loading too many static resources, check if
the response time of static resources is slow and scale out pairs of the 
ingress
 and 
xruntime-ui
 pods if needed:
1
. 
Log in to the service portal and press 
F12
 to access the developer console. Check the response time of each static
resource as shown in the screenshot below:
2
. 
If the response time of many static resources is more than 10s, run the following command to open the ingress configmap
and add the 
$request
 field to log format as shown in the screenshot below:
kubectl edit cm itom-nginx-ingress-configmap -n <namespace>
Note 
Details of the resources required for the Large profile are currently not available.

. 
The volume sizes may grow on a daily basis. Check 
Disk usage
 below for more details.
2
. 
Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server is supported and recommended. See more details in
the 
Support matrix for Azure deployment
.
3
. 
Check the 
Minimal Azure File Service Level
 below for the details to prepare Azure File for SMA. It's not
recommended to deploy the large size using Azure File.
4
. 
This is the minimum resources requirements for SMA deployment. According to sizing definition benchmark
results, our lab tests indicate the average CPU utilization is 40~60%, and the memory utilization is 60~75%.
If one node is down, it may cause services to be unavailable. From node high availability consideration, you
are recommended to add at least one additional node or more depending on your actual environments such
as ticket size, user access rate, and integrations.
