Install additional OO Components
Operations Orchestration (OO) supports the following components:
OO Remote Action Server (RAS): OO RAS enables execution in remote data centers and networks. The RAS interacts with
Central and polls it for operations to execute. Installation of external OO RAS is optional and depends on whether you
need additional RASes apart from that's already available when OO Central installs.
OO Workflow Designer: OO Workflow Designer is a web based environment for authoring flows, which is available as a
standalone product that you can deploy either on a Windows or Linux server. Installation of OO Workflow Designer is
optional and depends on your requirement to author flows. You need another installation for the OO Workflow Designer as
it's not installed along with OO Central.
