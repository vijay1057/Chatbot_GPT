Configure file storage
On the File Storage page, a list of NFS volumes required for the OMT and suite installation shows up. Before you proceed,
make sure that you have already configured the required NFS shares for OMT and the suite, and the exported NFS folders are
empty.
Two file system types are available for each NFS volume:
Self-Hosted NFS
: A distributed file system that allows a client to access the files on the remote server over a network
like local storage. In this case, the installer will check for the available mount points and mount the shared remote
directory to a local directory. Select this type for on-premises deployment.
Managed NFS
: A remote file system such as EFS, and NetApp. In this case, the installer will mount the shared remote
directory to a local directory.
To configure the file storage, perform the following steps:
1
. 
Configure the first volume:
a
. 
Select the 
Self-Hosted NFS
 or 
Managed 
NFS 
file system type. 
b
. 
Enter the NFS server host FQDN or IP address.
c
. 
If you selected 
Self-Hosted NFS
, select the NFS volume path from the drop-down list; if you selected 
Managed
NFS
, enter the NFS volume path. 
2
. 
Although you can repeat the steps above to manually configure the rest of the NFS volumes, we recommend using the
Auto-fill
 button if all NFS volumes that you have exported meet the following conditions:
are on the same NFS server
are located in the same parent folder ("<base directory>")
follow the same export path naming rule: <base directory>/<volume label on the web UI>
Once you have turned on the 
Auto-fill
 button, the installer automatically configures the remaining NFS volumes for you
as follows:
File Server
: same as the NFS hostname that you provided for the first volume
Exported Path
: <base directory>/<volume label on the web UI>. For example, if the <base directory> you
provided is 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/
, and the current volume's display label is 
db-backup-vol
, the installer
automatically populates the export path field with 
/var/vols/itom/itsma/db-backup-vol
.

. 
Click 
Next.
 The system validates the volume configurations and then proceeds to the next screen if the validation
succeeds. If the validation fails, you need to reconfigure the volumes and then click 
Next
 again.
Note
: The validation process may take a few minutes.
4
. 
A warning shows up. Click
 Yes 
to confirm that you are ready to start deploying the control plane nodes and worker
nodes.   
Note
After you click 
Yes
, you can't go back to the Select phase.
