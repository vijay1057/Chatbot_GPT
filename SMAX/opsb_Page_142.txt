Using shared IdM in containerized multi-deployment mode
Hybrid mode 
The hybrid mode follows the principles of a classic CMS deployment. The only difference is that UCMDB is running on-premises
and the SMA suite is in the cloud. See 
Native SACM hybrid mode
. 
Upgrade SMAX and/or UCMDB in a Native-SACM-enabled deployment
In general, to use Native SACM, the difference in versions of SMAX and UCMDB need to be the current version plus/minus 1.
For example, Native SACM can work between SMAX 2021.05 and UCMDB 2021.05/2021.02. The only exception is SMAX
2020.11, you have to run it with UCMDB 2020.11 to get Native SACM working. For details, see 
Prepare for the Native SACM
deployment
